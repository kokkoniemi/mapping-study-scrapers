Empowering computing students with proficiency in robotics via situated learning;With the increasing employment of robots in multiple areas such as smart manufacturing and intelligent transportation, both undergraduate and graduate students from computing related majors (e.g., computer science and information technology) demonstrated strong interests in learning robotics technology to broaden their career opportunities. However, instilling computing students with robotics knowledge remains a challenge since most of them have limited pre-training in engineering subjects such as electronics and mechatronics. Therefore, robotics education for computing students demands an immersive real-world learning environment by considering both theories and intensive hands-on projects. Different from traditional textbook-directed robotics learning, in this study, a situated learning-based robotics education pedagogy is proposed for computing students to equip them with robotics expertise and foster their problem-solving skills in real-world human–robot interaction contexts. To create a realistic human–robot collaboration situation, a multi-modal collaborative robot is employed in the classroom-based learning community for the whole semester. Mini-project-based homework and team projects are designed for students to practice their critical thinking and hands-on experiences. The bidirectional-evaluation approach is utilized by the instructor and students to assess the quality of the proposed pedagogy. Practice results and student evaluations suggested that the proposed situated learning-based pedagogy and robotics curriculum provided computing students to learn robotics in an effective way, which was well recognized and accepted by students even most of them were beginners. Future work of this study is also discussed.;2582906141;;Scholarly Journals; Montclair State University, Department of Computer Science, Montclair, USA (GRID:grid.260201.7) (ISNI:0000 0001 0745 9736) , Montclair State University, Department of Computer Science, Montclair, USA (GRID:grid.260201.7) (ISNI:0000 0001 0745 9736) , Montclair State University, Department of Computer Science, Montclair, USA (GRID:grid.260201.7) (ISNI:0000 0001 0745 9736);"Wang, Weitian;Coutras Constantine;Zhu, Michelle";;10.1186/s40561-021-00167-6; Journal Article; 2021-10-18; Dec 2021;;1; English; English;;; Heidelberg;Dec 2021;Smart Learning Environments;2021;8;https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/empowering-computing-students-with-proficiency/docview/2582906141/se-2;
ScrumOntoBDD: Agile software development based on scrum, ontologies and behaviour-driven development;"When developing a Learning Management System (LMS)&#xa0;using Scrum, we noticed that it was quite often necessary to redefine some system behaviour scenarios, due to ambiguities in the requirement specifications, or due to misinterpretations of stories reported by the Product Owners (POs). The definition of test suites was also cumbersome, resulting in test suites that were incomplete or did not at all comply with the system requirements. Based on this experience and to deal with these problems, in this paper, we propose the ScrumOntoBDD approach to agile software development, which combines Scrum, ontologies and Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD). This approach is centred on the concepts and techniques of Scrum and BDD and focuses on the planning and analysis phases of the software life cycle, since the BDD tools currently provide little support to these phases, while most of the problems during the LMS development were found exactly there. We claim that our approach improves the software development practices in this respect. Furthermore, ScrumOntoBDD employs ontologies in order to reduce ambiguities intrinsic to the use of a natural language as a BDD ubiquitous language. In this paper, we illustrate and systematically evaluate our approach, showing that it is beneficial since it improves the communication between members of an agile development team.";2540416441;;Scholarly Journals; Federal University of São Carlos, Department of Computing, São Carlos, Brazil (GRID:grid.411247.5) (ISNI:0000 0001 2163 588X) , Federal University of São Carlos, Department of Computing, São Carlos, Brazil (GRID:grid.411247.5) (ISNI:0000 0001 2163 588X) , University of Twente, Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Enschede, The Netherlands (GRID:grid.6214.1) (ISNI:0000 0004 0399 8953);"Lopes de Souza Pedro;Lopes de Souza Wanderley;Ferreira, Pires Luís";;10.1186/s13173-021-00114-w; Journal Article; 2021-06-13; Dec 2021;0104-6500;1; English; English;;; Rio de Janeiro;Dec 2021;Journal of the Brazilian Computer Society;2021;27;https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/scrumontobdd-agile-software-development-based-on/docview/2540416441/se-2;
Impact on the personality of engineering students based on project‐based learning;"In an engineering study, the project/knowledge application module has a great weightage where students get an opportunity for the application of knowledge. Project evaluation consists of the following phases: documentation, presentation, teamwork, and leadership. This study has used the entire duration of the project assessment process for the evaluation of personality changes along with the academic assessment for the duration of 2 years. The intervention used for the evaluation is strongly correlated with five factors (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) of the OCEAN model. Statistical and descriptive tests are used for the assessment of the relationship of interventions on academic performance, personality development, and placement activity with 95% confidence. The survey has been conducted at the end of 2 years to validate the obtained results on the basis of interventions. From the results, it has been found that students can actually work upon personality enhancement till the 7th semester whereas the improvement in learning and analytical skills is a continuous process and the students in the 8th semester have shown significant variation in these two assessed parameters. Thus, the proposed intervention approach is an appropriate tool, which helps students to improve their personality at five factors of the OCEAN model results in&#xa0;360° enhancement in the personality along with academic performance.";2595938345;;Scholarly Journals; Department of Virtualization, School of Computer Science, University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, India , Department of Virtualization, School of Computer Science, University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, Dehradun, India , Department of Computer Science and Information Management, Providence University, Taichung, R.O.C.;"Salankar, Nilima;Koundal, Deepika;Yu‐Chen Hu";;10.1002/cae.22412; Journal Article; 2021-03-28; Nov 2021;1061-3773;6; English; English;; 1602-1616; Hoboken;Nov 2021;Computer Applications in Engineering Education;2021;29;https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/impact-on-personality-engineering-students-based/docview/2595938345/se-2?accountid=11774; 1602
Teaching internet of things for engineering courses: A project-based cooperative approach;Internet of things is emerging in the recent years and is changing many traditional industries in the recent years. Engineering students of several knowledge areas may benefit with the introduction of internet of things concepts in the undergraduate courses, since there is an increasingly need of professionals to work in multidisciplinary teams. This paper proposes an undergraduate course to teach internet of things concepts for engineering students using cooperative problem-based learning (CPBL). The students have to develop a project using different internet of things technologies: sensing and actuation, embedded computing, communication and networking, cloud computing, and data analytics. The proposed course may help students to improve not only their technical skills but also soft skills, such as teamwork, communication and creativity. The developed projects achieved good results, and positive feedback was received from the students. Students from engineering courses related to internet of things had a better performance than students of no internet of things-related courses.;2610834763;;Scholarly Journals; Centro de Engenharia, Modelagem e Ciências Sociais Aplicadas, Universidade Federal do ABC, Santo André, Brazil;Kleinschmidt, João H;;10.1177/0020720919867437; Journal Article;; Oct 2021;0020-7209;4; English; English;; 858-873; Manchester;Oct 2021;International Journal of Electrical Engineering & Education;2021;58;https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/teaching-internet-things-engineering-courses/docview/2610834763/se-2?accountid=11774; 858
Implementing studio-based learning for design education: a study on the perception and challenges of Malaysian undergraduates;Studio-based learning (SBL) is a teaching and learning methodology that combines different learning pedagogies such as social constructivist, problem-based, and active learning to mimic real-world working experience. Traditionally, SBL is practised in architecture and art programmes, however there is a growing number of research in other areas such as computer science, engineering, entrepreneurship and design courses. Nevertheless, in Malaysia, studies have only focused on architecture programmes. Therefore, this study focuses on reporting the experience and challenges of implementing SBL for a design course in the area of Visual Communication. By employing a qualitative methodology, findings show positive perception towards SBL where respondents reported awareness in improved design and communication skills, and increased acceptance towards team work. They found the critique sessions, facilitated their learning progress. Nevertheless, students reported challenges with inept teaching and learning facilities for design work, collaboration and communication breakdown with stakeholders. The study also reports on improvement strategies to enhance students learning experience through SBL.;2550572752;;Scholarly Journals; Centre for Instructional Technology and Multimedia, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia (GRID:grid.11875.3a) (ISNI:0000 0001 2294 3534) , Universidade de Coimbra – Polo II, Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Sciences and Technology, Rua Sílvio Lima, Coimbra, Portugal (GRID:grid.8051.c) (ISNI:0000 0000 9511 4342) , Politeknik METrO Tasek Gelugor, Tasek Gelugor, Malaysia (GRID:grid.8051.c);"Kumar Jeya Amantha;Silva, Paula Alexandra;Renugha, Prelath";;10.1007/s10798-020-09566-1; Journal Article; 2020-02-15; Jul 2021;0957-7572;3; English; English;; 611-631; Dordrecht;Jul 2021;International Journal of Technology and Design Education;2021;31;https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/implementing-studio-based-learning-design/docview/2550572752/se-2?accountid=11774; 611
A multidisciplinary engineering capstone design course: A case study for design-based approach;The presented work describes the development of an engineering capstone course with multidisciplinary design projects and students’ teams. The course is offered for senior-level engineering students of four majors: those are bio-, environmental, materials, and mechanical engineering. In addition, engineering students can have minors in computer science. Most of the offered projects are sponsored by industrial partners and all are mentored by clients’ representatives and faculty members. The presented paper discusses the implementation of design-based learning approach to integrate the technical engineering design knowledge and the learning skills of interpersonal nature, such as communication skills, adaptability, teamwork, etc. In addition to the discussion of the design-based learning frame application, the paper deliberates over the importance of aligning the learning outcomes and the grading policy with the engineering design phases in engineering capstone design courses. The research objective of this study was to answer the following question: is there a difference in the peer evaluation of capstone design teams between multidisciplinary and single-disciplinary teams in terms of (1) contribution and skills and 2) team satisfaction. The presented work offers preliminary results of team’s satisfaction and performance based on the multi- and single-disciplinary teams. Preliminary findings for those two specific aspects indicate no significant differences in the overall design teams’ satisfaction. However, in terms of the team’s contribution and skills, the multidisciplinary teams scored higher mean values than the single-disciplinary teams.;2541259692;;Scholarly Journals; Department of Mechanical, Industrial & Manufacturing Engineering, University of Toledo, Toledo, OH , Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Merced, CA , Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Merced, CA , Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Merced, CA;"Qattawi Ala;Ala'aldin, Alafaghani;Ablat, Muhammad Ali;Jaman Md Shah";;10.1177/0306419019882622; Journal Article;; Jul 2021;0306-4190;3; English; English;; 223-241; Chichester;Jul 2021;International Journal of Mechanical Engineering Education;2021;49;https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/multidisciplinary-engineering-capstone-design/docview/2541259692/se-2?accountid=11774; 223
Studying phenological phenomena in subarctic biomes with international school pupils as citizen scientists;"Citizen science can facilitate in‐depth learning for pupils and students, contribute to scientific research, and permit civic participation. Here, we describe the development of the transnational school‐based citizen science project Phenology of the North Calotte . Its primary goal is to introduce pupils (age 12–15; grades 7–10) in northern Norway, Russia, and Finland to the local and global challenges of climate change resulting in life cycle changes at different trophic and ecosystem levels in their backyards. Partnerships between regional scientists and staff from NIBIO Svanhovd, State nature reserves, national parks, and teachers and pupils from regional schools aim to engage pupils in project‐based learning. The project uses standardized protocols, translated into the different languages of participating schools. The phenological observations are centered around documenting clearly defined life cycle phases (e.g., first appearance of species, flowering, ripening, leaf yellowing, snow fall, and melt). The observations are collected either on paper and are subsequently submitted manually to an open‐source online database or submitted directly via a newly developed mobile app. In the long term, the database is anticipated to contribute to research studying changes in phenology at different trophic levels. In principle, guided school‐based citizen science projects have the potential to contribute to increased environmental awareness and education and thereby to transformative learning at the societal level while contributing to scientific progress of understudied biomes, like the northern taiga and (sub)arctic tundra. However, differences in school systems and funding insecurity for some schools have been major prohibiting factors for long‐term retention of pupils/schools in the program. Project‐based and multidisciplinary learning, although pedagogically desired, has been partially difficult to implement in participating schools, pointing to the need of structural changes in national school curricula and funding schemes as well as continuous offers for training and networking for teachers.";2515100867;;Scholarly Journals; Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research, NIBIO – Division of Environment and Natural Resources, Ås, Norway , Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research, NIBIO – Division of Forest and Forest Resources, Ås, Norway , Pasvik State Nature Reserve, Rayakosky, Russia , Kandalaksha State Nature Reserve, Kandalaksha, Russia , Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research, NIBIO – Division of Forest and Forest Resources, Ås, Norway , Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research, NIBIO – Division of Environment and Natural Resources, Ås, Norway , Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research, NIBIO – Division of Environment and Natural Resources, Ås, Norway , Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research, NIBIO – Division of Environment and Natural Resources, Ås, Norway;"Cornelya F.

Problem based Learning: An Experience of Evaluation based on Indicators, Case of Electronic Business in Professional Career of Systems Engineering;"It is a reality that universities place great emphasis on formative research in the training of their students in order to increase their knowledge, skills, attitudes and achieve competences. This paper aims to show the experience of applying the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) methodology to assess learning based on indicators that have been determined from the criteria considered to correspond to the competences of the course under study Business Electronic, at the Professional School of Systems Engineering (EPIS) of the Universidad Nacional de San Agustín de Arequipa (UNSA), Arequipa-Peru, with theory and laboratory practice taught by two teachers. The objective is to apply an evaluation strategy for the development of competences with active didactics to the engineering training course. The methodology used is Problem-Based Learning applied to a formative research project based on real problems common to many organizations. In the semester, the students in groups solve the problems stated, and then they deliver a deliverable report and formative research report of each problem that is scored through a rubric. The teachers make contributions and provide feedback in the report for the improvement and experience that the student is acquiring in their training. The results obtained show that the objectives are achieved, increasing knowledge, skills, attitudes and adequate evaluation in the training of students, as well as the development of the competences of the course, as well as achieving the results of the student; showing that the application of PBL with Formative Research would provide good results for other courses of the professional career, allowing continuous improvement in the teaching-learning process. The conclusion is that an adequate assessment of learning based on indicators with an active didactic strategy, effectively planned and adequately applied to real-life problems, makes it possible to achieve the expected student results.";2655118497;;Scholarly Journals;;"Baluarte-Araya, César;Suarez-Lopez, Ernesto;Ramirez-Valdez, Oscar";;10.14569/IJACSA.2021.0120966; Journal Article;; 2021;2158-107X;9; English; English;;; West Yorkshire;2021;International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications;2021;12;https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/problem-based-learning-experience-evaluation-on/docview/2655118497/se-2; n/a
Employing DDR to Design and Develop a Flipped Classroom and Project based Learning Module to Applying Design Thinking in Design and Technology;"The purpose of this study is to discuss the Design and Development (DDR) research approach that was used to develop a Flipped Classroom and project-based learning modules for students of Design and Technology (D&amp;T). The module's fundamental theory is based on 21st-century teaching and learning models, as well as design thinking. The DDR process is divided into three phases: analysis of needs, design and development, and evaluation. The phase of needs analysis is used to ascertain the necessity of module development and the application of design thinking. Three distinct data collection methods were used in this phase: semi-structured interviews, survey studies, and document analysis. The findings from this phase serve as a backup for the next phase. The Isman Instructional Design Model (2011) is adapted for use in this phase as a guide for module design and development. Additionally, the Fuzzy Delphi Method is used to obtain expert consensus on module material design, teaching and learning strategies, software development and hardware development requirements, and module prototype evaluation. The final phase is implementation and evaluation, which focuses on determining the module's effectiveness in the actual teaching and learning process. Each finding is organised and documented more systematically and orderly in accordance with the DDR phase in order to produce more meaningful research results. The conclusion of this article proposes a conceptual framework for the research.";2655113129;;Scholarly Journals;;"Mohd Ridzuan Padzil;Aidah Abd Karim;Hazrati Husnin";;10.14569/IJACSA.2021.0120988; Journal Article;; 2021;2158-107X;9; English; English;;; West Yorkshire;2021;International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications;2021;12;https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/employing-ddr-design-develop-flipped-classroom/docview/2655113129/se-2; n/a
Discussion on Teaching Method of Digital Image Processing Technology Based on PBL;"A required course for students majoring in digital media technology, computer science and technology, or artificial intelligence is “digital image processing technology.” Aviation, medical image processing, intelligent manufacturing, and many more fields may benefit from the knowledge and skills gained in this course. It contains the qualities of “many conceptions, numerous principles, and various formulae,” according to the curriculum. As a result, traditional teaching techniques only pay attention to the explanation of theoretical information, which may easily lead students to create uninteresting feelings; they have abandoned the in-depth investigation and learning of the course material. The PBL approach is used to provide an interest-driven and problem-solving-driven grounded teaching technique that naturally connects the theoretical foundation with real-world examples and problems. We utilize case teaching to assist students better comprehend theoretical information and to teach them how to apply theoretical knowledge to actual difficulties they encounter in their lives. During the course of many semesters of practice, we discovered that our teaching approaches are quite popular with students. The deployment of a teaching style focused on problem-based learning has resulted in significant improvements in students’ learning initiative, practical ability, and innovative ability.";2611358689;;Scholarly Journals; School of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214122, China;Chen, Lifang; WeChat;10.1155/2021/2348258; Journal Article;; 2021;;; English; English;;; Oxford;2021;Wireless Communications & Mobile Computing (Online);2021;2021;https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/discussion-on-teaching-method-digital-image/docview/2611358689/se-2;
Education 4.0 and Computer Science: A European perspective;This systematic literature review aimed at identifying the pedagogical approaches, aligned with Education 4.0, used to support teaching computer science courses with undergraduate and graduate students in Europe. A three-step coding process was conducted to identify and analyse 20 papers. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of the selected papers revealed a three-cluster solution with common characteristics that could be used to describe those pedagogical approaches. The review also showed that the term Education 4.0 is still relatively new and has not been conceptualised in terms of computer science courses, although the characteristics of Education 4.0 are visible throughout the pedagogical approaches.;2604879789;;Conference Papers & Proceedings;;"Rienties, Bart;Ferguson, Rebecca;Herodotou, Christothea;Iniesto, Francisco;Sargent, Julia;Muccini, Henry;Balaban, Aigor;Virkus, Sirje";;; Conference Proceedings;; 2021;1847-2001;; English; English;; 139-146; Varazdin;2021;Central European Conference on Information and Intelligent Systems;2021;;https://www.proquest.com/conference-papers-proceedings/education-4-0-computer-science-european/docview/2604879789/se-2; 139
Comparing Competency Assessment in Electronics Engineering Education with and without Industry Training Partner by Challenge-Based Learning Oriented to Sustainable Development Goals;This study assessed the “creation of technological solutions for electronic devices” competencies evaluation when faculty–industry liaison is available. This experience at Tecnológico de Monterrey (TEC) was developed with challenge-based learning provided by the automotive electronics industry addressing subjects oriented toward some objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Electronics Engineering faculty and project engineers from automotive electronics and instrumentation companies promote design competencies in college students. This study analyzed the competency performance and outcome results of students who took applied electronics courses for the undergraduate level under the “i-Semester with industrial partner” for one semester and compared results with students that took the course under the traditional program. The competence evaluation was classified into three preliminary domain levels: 1 or low-level, 2 or medium-level, and 3 or high-level. Students were exposed to the conceptual, procedural, and attitudinal contents applied to solve the challenge assigned by the industrial partner. Students with an industrial partner showed a higher engagement, and they were more motivated in learning the subject, compared to students having classes in the traditional way. This study showed that in developing the competency “create technological solutions for electronic devices”, 55 students with an industrial partner obtained higher domain levels than 61 students with the traditional course.;2581066656;;Scholarly Journals;;"Dieck-Assad, Graciano;Ávila-Ortega, Alfonso;Omar Israel González Peña";;10.3390/su131910721; Journal Article; 2021-09-27; 2021;;19; English; English;;; Basel;2021;Sustainability;2021;13;https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/comparing-competency-assessment-electronics/docview/2581066656/se-2; 10721
Two Decades of PBL in Teaching Computing: A Systematic Mapping Study;Contribution: This article adds to the results of previous systematic mapping study by addressing a more ample context of problem-based learning (PBL) in computing education. Background: PBL is defined as an instructional method of constructivist teaching that uses real problems as a motivating element for learning. Although PBL was born in medical education, it has been used in computing education to facilitate the students’ engagement and learning capacity, contributing to developing skills, such as teamwork, holistic vision, critical thinking, and solving problem. Considering that approach much more descriptive than prescriptive, it favors the implementation of diverse methodologies on its behalf. Research Question: “How the PBL approach has been applied in teaching computing?” Methodology: From the initial set of 3837 studies, 102 primary studies were selected and categorized through Kitchenham methodology for analysis from 1999 to 2019. Findings: Based on these studies, it was possible to verify a greater adoption of PBL in undergraduate education and a great diversity of strategies involving real-world problems, developing technical and no-technical skills and making the student much more motivated and engaged. Challenges were also mapped, which shows a very interesting field for new research.;2557983503;;Scholarly Journals; Centro de Informática, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil , Centro de Informática, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil , Centro de Informática, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil , Centro de Informática, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil;"dos Santos, Simone C;Reis, Priscila B S;Reis, Jacinto F S;Tavares, Fabio";;10.1109/TE.2020.3033416; Journal Article; 2021-08-02; 2021;0018-9359;3; English; English;; 233-244; New York;2021;IEEE Transactions on Education;2021;64;https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/two-decades-pbl-teaching-computing-systematic/docview/2557983503/se-2?accountid=11774; 233
Shared Learning from the Implementation of a Technical Leadership Program;"Capstone projects have been an established vehicle of student–industry engagement in a university setting. In engineering, capstone projects are a point of transition from student to professional, as student engineers gain practical work experience and apply their technical skills and knowledge for an industry-proposed design, research, and/or development challenge. In this paper, we report on a supplementary program—the Technical Leadership Program (TLP)—which was designed and delivered for students to hone their technical leadership skills within a capstone project. To report on the outcomes of this case study, we use a student-as-partners philosophy to share the case study as a series of vignettes from co-authors who participated in the TLP. These have been collated into four key thematic areas including building awareness through technical leadership; building a personal repertoire of leadership; creating a common platform for collaboration; and transitioning into a professional workplace environment. The reflections are then shown to map to relevant competencies in technical leadership. Alongside these themes, the paper shares the design of the TLP delivery and reflects on the challenges and benefits of this mechanism to enhance student experience.";2539994946;;Scholarly Journals;" ANU College of Engineering and Computer Science, The Australian National University, Canberra ACT 0200, Australia;

STEAM projects with KIKS format for developing key competences;Los currículos de educación secundaria resaltan el aprendizaje por competencias, aunque actualmente no se observan cambios sustanciales en los hábitos de intervención en el aula. Las iniciativas implementadas se han centrado principalmente en impulsar el desarrollo conjunto de tres competencias clave como máximo. Este artículo presenta un estudio internacional bajo los programas Erasmus+ y H2020, con el objetivo de establecer relaciones entre el aprendizaje basado en proyectos STEAM con formato KIKS (Kids Inspire Kids for STEAM) y el desarrollo global de las competencias clave. La muestra incluye 267 estudiantes de secundaria distribuidos en 53 equipos de 29 centros de Finlandia, Inglaterra, Hungría y España. Cada equipo elaboró varios proyectos durante al menos dos años académicos con los siguientes enfoques de implementación: aprendizaje basado en proyectos STEAM y KIKS. Los datos se recabaron por medio de observaciones y entrevistas a estudiantes, profesores y formadores KIKS. Los análisis revelaron que la combinación de ambos enfoques facilita el desarrollo de las ocho competencias clave. El aprendizaje por proyectos favoreció esencialmente la competencia matemática y en ciencia, tecnología e ingeniería, mientras que el formato KIKS potenció las competencias en lectoescritura y multilingüe. El resto se vieron estimuladas por la combinación de ambos enfoques. Cabe destacar que la participación prolongada en el programa de implementación fue determinante en los resultados obtenidos.;2476176661; Proyectos STEAM con formato KIKS para el desarrollo de competencias clave;Scholarly Journals; Department of Mathematics, Statistics and Computing, University of Cantabria (Spain) , University of Santiago de Compostela (Spain) , Department of Mathematics, Statistics and Computing, University of Cantabria (Spain) , STEM Education Center, Johannes Kepler University, Linz (Austria);"Diego-Mantecón, José-Manuel;Blanco, Teresa-F;Ortiz-Laso, Zaira;Lavicza, Zsolt";;10.3916/C66-2021-03; Journal Article;; 2021;;66; English; English; Proyectos STEAM con formato KIKS para el desarrollo de competencias clave; 33-42; Huelva;2021;Comunicar;2021;29;https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/steam-projects-with-kiks-format-developing-key/docview/2476176661/se-2?accountid=11774; 33
Finding time for computer science in the elementary school day: a quasi-experimental study of a transdisciplinary problem-based learning approach;Background As the number of computer science (CS) jobs become increasingly available in this country and computing skills become essential tools for managing all aspects of our personal lives, CS is quickly becoming an essential element of K-12 education and recently, there has been increased attention to bringing computer science to the elementary grades. However, with a schedule that emphasizes literacy and mathematics, and other subjects competing for instructional time, creating opportunities for CS in the elementary school day is challenging. This study aimed to address this problem by investigating the use of problem-based transdisciplinary modules (i.e., “Time4CS” modules) that combined English language arts (ELA), science, and social studies lessons with the Code.org “Fundamentals” CS education program. Results Results indicated that teachers who taught Time4CS modules completed more CS lessons than teachers who did not teach the modules. Further, across all classrooms, completing a higher percentage of non-grade level assigned Code.org Fundamentals lessons (i.e., Code.org lessons above or below grade level that were available to teachers, but not required for their particular grade level) was positively associated with students’ achievement outcomes on state ELA and mathematics tests. Additionally, higher amounts of interdisciplinary teaching practices were associated with higher student achievement, specifically students’ state assessment ELA scores. Conclusions This study demonstrated that transdisciplinary problem-based modules that integrate the teaching of CS with other subject areas are a feasible way to bring more CS opportunities to younger learners. Moreover, it showed that implementing such modules is linked to more positive student academic achievement outcomes. With attentive revision, the modules featured in this study may be useful tools for elementary schools. These findings have implications for researchers, school district administrators, and those individuals who are in-charge of public policy initiatives seeking ways to bring CS to all elementary school students. Specifically, they highlight that it is possible to make time in the elementary school day for CS, and that there are no negative consequences for core subjects (e.g., ELA and mathematics).;2403243423;;Scholarly Journals; University of Chicago, Outlier Research & Evaluation at UChicago STEM Education, Chicago, USA (GRID:grid.170205.1) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 7822) , University of Chicago, Outlier Research & Evaluation at UChicago STEM Education, Chicago, USA (GRID:grid.170205.1) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 7822) , University of Chicago, Outlier Research & Evaluation at UChicago STEM Education, Chicago, USA (GRID:grid.170205.1) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 7822);"Century Jeanne;Ferris, Kaitlyn A;Zuo Huifang"; Code.org;10.1186/s40594-020-00218-3; Journal Article; 2020-05-15; Dec 2020;;1; English; English;;; Heidelberg;Dec 2020;International Journal of STEM Education;2020;7;https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/finding-time-computer-science-elementary-school/docview/2403243423/se-2;
Aerial Drone: an Effective Tool to Teach Information Technology and Cybersecurity through Project Based Learning to Minority High School Students in the U.S.;This paper describes the design, implementation, and results of an NSF funded Summer Academy from 2016 to 2018, which engaged, on an annual basis, 30 to 60 rising 10th and 11th grade high school science students in an innovative, technology-enriched Project Based Learning (PBL) environment. This Academy emphasized how tech gadgets work and the impact that technology can have on improving communities by immersing students in the exploration of one such device that is a growing phenomenon, the “aerial drone.” In this Academy, the students learned various operations of the drone through Python programming language, and some cybersecurity issues and solutions. The student teams, under the guidance of diverse mentors, comprehensively fortified their STEM problem-solving skills and critical thinking. Both formative and summative evaluations for this Academy showed that it helped students improve their critical thinking ability and motivated them to pursue careers in STEM-related disciplines, specifically in information technology and cybersecurity areas.;2471527049;;Scholarly Journals; Tuskegee University, College of Business and Information Science, Tuskegee, USA (GRID:grid.265253.5) (ISNI:0000 0001 0707 9354) , Tuskegee University, College of Business and Information Science, Tuskegee, USA (GRID:grid.265253.5) (ISNI:0000 0001 0707 9354) , Tuskegee University, College of Business and Information Science, Tuskegee, USA (GRID:grid.265253.5) (ISNI:0000 0001 0707 9354) , Tuskegee University, College of Business and Information Science, Tuskegee, USA (GRID:grid.265253.5) (ISNI:0000 0001 0707 9354) , Auburn University, Department of Educational Foundations, Leadership& Technology, Auburn, USA (GRID:grid.252546.2) (ISNI:0000 0001 2297 8753) , Auburn University, Department of Educational Foundations, Leadership& Technology, Auburn, USA (GRID:grid.252546.2) (ISNI:0000 0001 2297 8753);"Bhuyan, Jay;Wu, Fan;Thomas, Cassandra;Koong Kai;Hur, Jung Won;Wang, Chih-hsuan";;10.1007/s11528-020-00502-7; Journal Article; 2020-04-22; Nov 2020;8756-3894;6; English; English;; 899-910; Washington;Nov 2020;TechTrends;2020;64;https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/aerial-drone-effective-tool-teach-information/docview/2471527049/se-2?accountid=11774; 899
Integrating novel engineering strategies into STEM education: APP design and an assessment of engineering‐related attitudes;Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education has become an international priority. STEM education provides students with interdisciplinary knowledge and promotes the cultivation of high‐level skills. However, STEM training opportunities for teachers are rare, which results in fewer opportunities for primary and secondary students to receive high‐quality engineering education. Novel Engineering is an innovative strategy to integrate engineering and literacy in STEM education. To this end, the researchers developed, implemented and evaluated a novel engineering STEM software program based on the story of Robinson Crusoe. A quasi‐experimental single‐group pre‐ and posttest research method was adopted. A total of 72 students in two seventh grade classes at a junior middle school in Shanghai participated in the study. Data were collected and analysed through STEM learning interest scales, flow status scales, interviews and students’ STEM work scores. The research findings demonstrated that students gave a high evaluation of the novel engineering STEM software program. Furthermore, this STEM software program contributed to students’ significant improvements in the attitudes of mathematics and 21st century skill and provided students with a lasting and better flow experience. Finally, suggestions were proposed for STEM software design, implementation and evaluation. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Novel engineering is an innovative teaching strategy to integrate literacy and engineering in K12 education. Students can take classroom literature from the existing curriculum, like stories, novels and textbook to use the basis for engineering design challenges. Through this approach, they learn to identify problems, to design realistic solutions, and to engage in the Engineering Design Process, all while reinforcing their STEM literacy. Teamwork, short‐term projects and problem‐based learning benefits students' STEM learning. What this paper adds This paper uses a STEM APP as the scaffolding to integrate STEM instruction and novel engineering. This paper investigates students' usage status from interest, flow state, interview and other dimensions. Software design is problem‐driven, team‐driven, responsibility assigned to work together on a short‐term task. Implications for practice and/or policy This paper develops STEM software based on novel engineering to provide ideas for other developers. This paper provides advice to practitioners of similar STEM programs. STEM software of novel engineering is verified as one kind of learning scaffolding.;2457132257;;Scholarly Journals;;"Wang, Liyan;Feng‐Kuang Chiang";;10.1111/bjet.13031; Journal Article; 2020-09-18; Nov 2020;0007-1013;6; English; English;; 1938-1959; Coventry;Nov 2020;British Journal of Educational Technology;2020;51;https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/integrating-novel-engineering-strategies-into/docview/2457132257/se-2?accountid=11774; 1938
Problem based Learning with Information and Communications Technology Support: An Experience in the Teaching-Learning of Matrix Algebra;Students and teachers face problems in the teaching-learning processes of matrix algebra, due to the level of abstraction required, the difficulty of calculation and the way in which the contents are presented. Problem-based Learning (PBL) arises as a solution to this problem, as it contextualizes the contents in everyday life, allows students to actively build that knowledge and contributes to the development of skills. The proposal describes a didactic sequence based on PBL, which uses cooperative techniques and MATLAB, as instruments that facilitate the resolution of problems close to the student experience. The features of the Moodle platform are used to support the face-to-face educational process. The perception of students, in relation to the activity shows that 83% believe that it contributed to the understanding of the topics covered and 79% think that it allowed them to develop their creativity and capacity for expression.;2655155511;;Scholarly Journals;;"Bedregal-Alpaca, Norka;Sharhorodska, Olha;Tupacyupanqui-Jaen, Doris;Corneko-Aparicio, Victor";;10.14569/IJACSA.2020.0110315; Journal Article;; 2020;2158-107X;3; English; English;;; West Yorkshire;2020;International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications;2020;11;https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/problem-based-learning-with-information/docview/2655155511/se-2; n/a
Project based Learning Application Experience in Engineering Courses: Database Case in the Professional Career of Systems Engineering;"In many universities, training research is applied in courses as a basic element of research and fundamental in the professional training of every student, which result in strengthening and increasing knowledge about certain areas, as well as to achieve skills, competence, abilities and attitudes. The present work shows the formal application experience of the Project Based Learning (ABPr) methodology in Database Course (BD) at the Professional School of Systems Engineering (EPIS) of the National University of San Agustín (UNSA), Arequipa-Peru, accommodating the nature of the course being the theory taught by a teacher and laboratory practices by another teacher. The goal is to apply an active teaching strategy to an engineering training course. The methodology used is Project-Based Learning for a research project training for a real problem in an organization to be developed by each team in the semester, with deliverables that will be evaluated by grade scale and the formative research report assessed through the rubric; the input and feedback that the teacher makes of them serves for the improvement and experience in the training of the student. The results obtained show that the objectives in the training of students were achieved, as well as the development of the competencies related to the course, in addition that the application of ABPr gives good results for courses of an engineering career serving as feedback for the continuous improvement of this course and experience for the implementation of ABPr in other curriculum courses. Concluding that formative research as a pillar of a basic level of research initiation is given in a cross-cutting way in the curriculum courses, that the active teaching strategies properly planned and properly applied to each reality allow to achieve the desired results such as: increase knowledge of the area, strengthen skills, abilities, attitudes as the case of the present.";2655155391;;Scholarly Journals;;Baluarte-Araya, César;;10.14569/IJACSA.2020.0110316; Journal Article;; 2020;2158-107X;3; English; English;;; West Yorkshire;2020;International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications;2020;11;https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/project-based-learning-application-experience/docview/2655155391/se-2; n/a
Difficulties in Teaching Online with Blackboard Learn Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Western Branch Colleges of Qassim University;The global COVID-19 pandemic has compelled educational institutions to shift from face-to-face teaching methods to fully online courses. This was possible with the help of information technology advances, which led to the creation of Blackboard Learn, a Learning Management System (LMS). By transitioning their systems to this newly developed LMS, the western branch colleges of Qassim University in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia were able to support e-learning. To investigate the influence of online learning e-courses on educational institutions and learning outcomes, this paper intends to perform surveys on both faculties and students. The survey mainly focuses on course objectives, practical skills, faculty member’s responses regarding query and discussion, explanations on applied courses, problem-solving, and improving teamwork skills. A comprehensive investigation of the faculties reveals that 59.08% of faculty members believe it is challenging to facilitate course objectives due to the lack of practical lab work and other detailed knowledge exchange on applied courses, which leads to the faculties being unsatisfied with online courses when compared with traditional systems. Moreover, 77.17% of the students think it is difficult to have discussions during online courses in order to solve queries, and this diminishes their problem-solving capability. In addition, with an online course system, there is no way to physically collaborate in teams and work on team projects to improve teamwork abilities.;2655154041;;Scholarly Journals;;Alturise, Fahad; Qassim University;10.14569/IJACSA.2020.0110512; Journal Article;; 2020;2158-107X;5; English; English;;; West Yorkshire;2020;International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications;2020;11;https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/difficulties-teaching-online-with-blackboard/docview/2655154041/se-2; n/a

Data Visualization: Bringing Data to Life in an Introductory Statistics Course;Although the use of tables, graphs, and figures to summarize information has long existed, the advent of the big data era and improved computing power has brought renewed attention to the field of data visualization. As such, it is crucial that introductory statistics courses train students to become critical authors and consumers of data visualizations. To that end, we have developed a semester-long, instructor-supported, group project that exposes students to this growing field. We have found this project to be an exciting and effective way to teach students the power of statistics and, more importantly, the critical role context plays when interpreting statistics. Among the many benefits of this project are hands-on learning, improved mathematical reasoning, and better collaboration and communication skills. In this article, we describe the project structure, project assessment, and techniques for facilitating effective group work.;2474250250;;Scholarly Journals;" Department of Statistics, Miami University, Oxford, OH; , RTI Health Solutions, Research Triangle Park, NC";"Hudiburgh, Lynette M;Garbinsky, Diana";;10.1080/10691898.2020.1796399; Journal Article;; 2020;;3; English; English;; 262-279; Alexandria;2020;Journal of Statistics Education;2020;28;https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/data-visualization-bringing-life-introductory/docview/2474250250/se-2; 262

Integrating a Cross-Reference List and Customer Journey Map to Improve Industrial Design Teaching and Learning in “Project-Oriented Design Based Learning”;To train students’ practical ability in design, enterprise projects are often introduced into the industrial design courses of Chinese universities. However, such project-oriented learning activity (POA) is often not well designed. This not only makes it difficult to improve learning effectiveness, but also may bring the unpleasant learning experience to students. The learning experience and learning effectiveness are equally important, and they are mutually conditional and complementary. To consider both, POA needs to be elaborately designed. To this end, a variety of mature POA organization forms, such as project-based learning (PBL), design-based learning (DBL), and project-oriented design-based learning (PODBL), are discussed firstly. PODBL integrates and inherits the advantages of other learning models, and it has been preliminarily proved to improve the learning effectiveness of engineering design courses. Therefore, a cross-reference list was proposed for upgrading POA to PODBL. A lamp design course was developed based on this checklist and students were organized to study. The customer journey map tool was used to analyze the learning experience of students in the course journey, and the emotions and pain points were obtained, as well as some critical factors leading to a positive learning experience. Finally, to demonstrate the availability of the cross-reference list and critical factors, a baby strollers design project course was developed and participants were interviewed. The results show that the cross-reference list and critical factors could improve learning effectiveness and enhance the learning experience significantly.;2412471127;;Scholarly Journals;" School of Art and Design, Wuhan University of Science & Technology, Wuhan 430065, China; <email>aixianfeng@wust.edu.cn</email> (X.A.); <email>hukang@wust.edu.cn</email> (K.H.); Hubei Key Laboratory of Mechanical Transmission and Manufacturing Engineering, Wuhan University of Science & Technology, Wuhan 430081, China , Hubei Key Laboratory of Mechanical Transmission and Manufacturing Engineering, Wuhan University of Science & Technology, Wuhan 430081, China; International School, Wuhan University of Science & Technology, Wuhan 430081, China , School of Art and Design, Wuhan University of Science & Technology, Wuhan 430065, China; <email>aixianfeng@wust.edu.cn</email> (X.A.); <email>hukang@wust.edu.cn</email> (K.H.) , School of Software and Electrical Engineering, Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn 3122, Australia , Department of Computing, Engineering and Mathematics, University of Brighton, Brighton BN2 4GJ, UK; <email>Y.Wang5@brighton.ac.uk</email>";"Ai, Xianfeng;Jiang, Zhigang;Hu, Kang;Chandrasekaran, Siva;Wang, Yan";;10.3390/su12114672; Journal Article; 2020-06-08; 2020;;11; English; English;;; Basel;2020;Sustainability;2020;12;https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/integrating-cross-reference-list-customer-journey/docview/2412471127/se-2; 4672
Teaching Natural Language Processing through Big Data Text Summarization with Problem-Based Learning;Natural language processing (NLP) covers a large number of topics and tasks related to data and information management, leading to a complex and challenging teaching process. Meanwhile, problem-based learning is a teaching technique specifically designed to motivate students to learn efficiently, work collaboratively, and communicate effectively. With this aim, we developed a problem-based learning course for both undergraduate and graduate students to teach NLP. We provided student teams with big data sets, basic guidelines, cloud computing resources, and other aids to help different teams in summarizing two types of big collections: Web pages related to events, and electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs). Student teams then deployed different libraries, tools, methods, and algorithms to solve the task of big data text summarization. Summarization is an ideal problem to address learning NLP since it involves all levels of linguistics, as well as many of the tools and techniques used by NLP practitioners. The evaluation results showed that all teams generated coherent and readable summaries. Many summaries were of high quality and accurately described their corresponding events or ETD chapters, and the teams produced them along with NLP pipelines in a single semester. Further, both undergraduate and graduate students gave statistically significant positive feedback, relative to other courses in the Department of Computer Science. Accordingly, we encourage educators in the data and information management field to use our approach or similar methods in their teaching and hope that other researchers will also use our data sets and synergistic solutions to approach the new and challenging tasks we addressed.;2384385480;;Scholarly Journals; Department of Computer Science, Virginia Tech, VA 24061, USA , Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Tech, VA 24061, USA;"Li, Liuqing;Geissinger, Jack;Ingram, William A;Fox, Edward A";;10.2478/dim-2020-0003; Journal Article; 2020-03-24; 2020;;1; English; English;; 18-43; Warsaw;2020;Data and Information Management;2020;4;https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/teaching-natural-language-processing-through-big/docview/2384385480/se-2; 18
Immersive virtual reality to enforce teaching in engineering education;Prior studies on the use of digital prototyping and virtual reality (VR) in designing as well as evaluating new products have shown that VR reduces both development time and costs whilst augmenting student motivation and creativity. The current study demonstrates that VR and 3D prototyping in the context of project-based learning (PBL) promote effective communication, increase problem solving skills, and enhance learning outcomes. VR and digital prototyping have been extensively used in industries for the purpose of product design and usability evaluation. In the context of engineering education, many research studies have attempted to explore the effect of VR on teamwork, engagement, retention, and motivation. In this paper, VR is used in conjunction with PBL in self-directed approach to design and implement a product using 3D software whilst also using virtual reality immersive CAVE display to evaluate their design. The hypothesis is that the use of VR with a project-based-learning approach to facilitate the attainment of desirable goals in the engineering design project, improved achievement of course learning outcomes and promoted effective communication. According to the research findings, VR approach significantly affected the distribution of cumulative project grades. Students’ project grades improved, particularly the implementation component. In addition, the course outcomes related to project design were better achieved in VR approach. The communication and problem-solving skills were improved in the VR approach as compared to traditional approach.;2359905953;;Scholarly Journals; Qatar University, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Doha, Qatar (GRID:grid.412603.2) (ISNI:0000 0004 0634 1084);Halabi Osama;;10.1007/s11042-019-08214-8; Journal Article; 2019-12-04; Jan 2020;1380-7501;3-4; English; English;; 2987-3004; Dordrecht;Jan 2020;Multimedia Tools and Applications;2020;79;https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/immersive-virtual-reality-enforce-teaching/docview/2359905953/se-2; 2987
Makerspaces in First-Year Engineering Education;Langara College, as one of the leading undergraduate institutions in the province of British Columbia (BC), offers the “Applied Science for Engineering” two-year diploma program as well as the “Engineering Transfer” two-semester certificate program. Three project-based courses are offered as part of the two-year diploma program in Applied Science (APSC) and Computer Science (CPSC) departments: “APSC 1010—Engineering and Technology in Society”, “CPSC 1090—Engineering Graphics”, and “CPSC 1490—Applications of Microcontrollers”, with CPSC 1090 and CPSC 1490 also part of the Engineering Transfer curriculum. Although the goals, scopes, objectives, and evaluation criteria of these courses are different, the main component of all three courses is a group-based technical project. Engineering students have access to Langara College’s Makerspace for the hands-on component of their project. Makerspaces expand experiential learning opportunities and allows students to gain a skillset outside the traditional classroom. This paper begins with a detailed review of the maker movement and the impact of makerspace in higher education. Different forms of makerspace and the benefits of incorporating them on first-year students’ creativity, sense of community, self-confidence, and entrepreneurial skills are discussed. This paper introduces Langara’s engineering program and its project-based design courses. Langara’s interdisciplinary makerspace, its goals and objectives, equipment, and some sample projects are introduced in this paper in detail. We then explain how the group-project component of APSC 1010, CPSC 1090, and CPSC 1490 are managed and how using makerspace improves students’ performance in such projects. In conclusion, the paper describes the evaluation of learning outcomes via an anonymous student survey.;2330817727;;Scholarly Journals;;"Taheri, Pooya;Robbins, Philip;Maalej, Sirine"; Massachusetts Institute of Technology;10.3390/educsci10010008; Journal Article; 2019-12-27; 2020;;1; English; English;;; Basel;2020;Education Sciences;2020;10;https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/makerspaces-first-year-engineering-education/docview/2330817727/se-2; 8
