The analysis results showed that learners’ critical thinking was impacted by learning models implemented in the classroom and influenced by the interaction between the learning models and learners’ academic abilities. There was no difference in critical thinking among low-ability students who were taught with PBL, conventional, and integrated PBL-NHT, but a difference was found in students taught using NHT. There was no difference in critical thinking between high-ability students taught with conventional and NHT instruction, but there was a difference between students taught with PBL and integrated PBL-NHT instruction. To foster critical thinking, pupils with low academic ability should be taught using NHT, whereas those with high academic ability should be taught using PBL or an integrated PBL-NHT approach. © 2021, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

These chatbots are strategized to provide personalized learning through the concept of a virtual assistant that replicates humanized conversation. Nevertheless, in the education paradigm, ECs are still novel with challenges in facilitating, deploying, designing, and integrating it as an effective pedagogical tool across multiple fields, and one such area is project-based learning. Therefore, the present study investigates how integrating ECs to facilitate team-based projects for a design course could influence learning outcomes. Based on a mixed-method quasi-experimental approach, ECs were found to improve learning performance and teamwork with a practical impact. Moreover, it was found that ECs facilitated collaboration among team members that indirectly influenced their ability to perform as a team. Nevertheless, affective-motivational learning outcomes such as perception of learning, need for cognition, motivation, and creative self-efficacy were not influenced by ECs. Henceforth, this study aims to add to the current body of knowledge on the design and development of EC by introducing a new collective design strategy and its pedagogical and practical implications. © 2021, The Author(s).","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",23659440,,,"Int. j. educ. technol. high. educ.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121298226

Studies on innovation in higher education examined the way students perceive themselves as innovators, while others examined the level of innovation in learning products. Research has yet to address the association between innovation as expressed in students' self-reports and in students' learning products. Moreover, since due to the COVID-19 outbreak, many faculties rely primarily on online platforms to deliver courses, there is a growing need to identify students’ innovation in online learning environments. This study aimed to examine higher education students' innovation as expressed in their self-reports and in their learning products, while comparing two formats of the same engineering course: an on-campus synchronous face-to-face (F2F) course, and a fully online asynchronous course. The participants were divided into two groups: F2F students (n = 103), and online students (n = 108). Applying the quasi-experimental design, data were collected via a pre- and post-questionnaire, and students' mean scores on the innovation level of their learning products. Findings indicated that both F2F and online students self-reported similar levels of innovative behavioral tendencies. Yet, the F2F students received higher mean scores on innovation, compared with the online students, in both individual assignments and team projects. We conclude by suggesting guidelines to better promote students’ innovation in higher education courses delivered online. © 2021","Elsevier Ltd",18711871,,,"Think.

However, instilling computing students with robotics knowledge remains a challenge since most of them have limited pre-training in engineering subjects such as electronics and mechatronics. Therefore, robotics education for computing students demands an immersive real-world learning environment by considering both theories and intensive hands-on projects. Different from traditional textbook-directed robotics learning, in this study, a situated learning-based robotics education pedagogy is proposed for computing students to equip them with robotics expertise and foster their problem-solving skills in real-world human–robot interaction contexts. To create a realistic human–robot collaboration situation, a multi-modal collaborative robot is employed in the classroom-based learning community for the whole semester. Mini-project-based homework and team projects are designed for students to practice their critical thinking and hands-on experiences. The bidirectional-evaluation approach is utilized by the instructor and students to assess the quality of the proposed pedagogy. Practice results and student evaluations suggested that the proposed situated learning-based pedagogy and robotics curriculum provided computing students to learn robotics in an effective way, which was well recognized and accepted by students even most of them were beginners. Future work of this study is also discussed. © 2021, The Author(s).","Springer",21967091,,,"Smart Learn. Environ.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117613318

Considering that typical computers and even the common smartphone are multicore, students should be skilled in parallel programming. Integrating parallel programming and soft skills within courses can help educate students on these essential skills. Our goal is to explore the effectiveness of using Project Based Learning (PBL) to teach these skills when classes are at content capacity. We divide 247 students into 51 diverse groups and assigned five projects, each of two-week duration. We use pre- and post-surveys to measure growth and found that incorporating PBL has a significant effect on the students' parallel programming and soft skills. We show that through teamwork, students collaboratively learn and apply fundamental parallel programming and soft skills without direct guidance, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of PBL. The implementation was conducted in a course that does not traditionally teach parallel programming concepts, but with the use of a PBL approach, students were able to acquire this new knowledge. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Academic Press Inc.",07437315,,JPDCE,"J.

Likewise, in recent years, written exams, assignments, and oral presentations show transmission-skill deficiencies among engineering students. Flipped teaching serves to boost students to meet these outcomes and other competencies: comprehension reading, communication skills, character building, collaborative work, critical thinking, or creativity. So, flipped learning is more than watching videos. This research proposes two evidence-based transferable learning strategies built on a flipped-teaching model and was applied by the authors in engineering courses during the second year of the global pandemic caused by COVID-19: problem-based learning and teamwork assignments. The study comprised two phases. First, a systematic review of reports, writings, and exams delivered by students. It included some video-watching analytics to detect misuse. In the second stage, the authors ascertained trends of these outcomes. Student perceptions and other achievement indicators illustrate the possibilities for encouraging learners to achieve transmission, communication, and literacy outcomes. Results indicate that these learner-centered approaches may help students learn better, comprehend, apply, and transmit knowledge. But they require an institutional commitment to implementing proactive instruction techniques that emphasize the importance of student communication skills. © 2021 by the authors.

In this curriculum, a modern approach to the teaching-learning process was applied, suitable for the interdisciplinary and multinational learning challenges that smart cities impose, but within the framework of a university-industry European partnership. Design/methodology/approach: To develop the curriculum, the competences needed for smart cities, common to all disciplines and fields, had to be researched. In addition, real smart cities projects also had to be selected for work following a project-based learning methodology. For both, this study applied the Delphi method, selecting the most relevant ones based on the data obtained by performing a multi-criteria decision analysis. Findings: The procedure followed for the identification of transversal competences in a field, the design of an innovative online training program and the results of the first edition of the program are discussed. Research limitations/implications: The processes that were developed, both to detect the most relevant transversal competences and to design the online training program, could be extrapolated to other areas. Moreover, it is very likely that the competences detected in this work could also be extrapolated, for the most part, to interdisciplinary teams. Originality/value: To date, there is no European initiative addressing the challenges of smart cities that requires a major adjustment in higher education, in the relationship between universities and all the mechanisms of lifelong learning with the industry related to smart cities.

However, students often experience unsuccessful project outcomes due to several factors, such as unfocused negotiation and lack of project monitoring. In this study, a group regulation promotion approach was developed. The proposed approach consisted of a group-regulated learning module that allows students to set learning goals, divide work and adjust their learning progress. There is also a platform for students to share their learning goals, observe others’ work and discuss with their peers. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a 6-month experiment was conducted in a higher education context. A total of 50 undergraduate students aged 19–20 years old participated in this research. One class assigned as the experimental group learned with the proposed approach, whereas the other class assigned as the control group learned with the collaborative project-based learning approach. The results revealed that the proposed approach benefited the students’ group learning performance, individual learning performance and their perception of group regulation. In addition, students who learned through the promotion mechanism showed more active learning behaviours. In sum, the integration of the group regulation promotion approach can be an effective means of enhancing students’ learning performance. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Collaborative project-based learning has been regarded as a comprehensive approach for teaching and learning. Technologies benefit students by facilitating online and offline collaborative project-based learning. Group regulation has been recognized as an important and challenging factor affecting students' performances in project-based learning. What this paper adds A group regulation promotion approach was developed to encourage students to engage in continuous group regulation with their peers. A group-regulated learning module was provided to help students set learning goals, divide work, and adjust their learning progress. A sharing platform was developed to assist student in sharing their learning goals, observing others' work, and discussing with their peers. The proposed approach promoted the students’ group learning performance, their individual learning performance, and active regulated learning behaviors. Implications for practice and/or policy The group regulation promotion approach is a potential strategy for implementing collaborative learning activities, especially for improving students’ active regulated learning behaviors. It is worth deeply investigating students’ regulated learning behaviors in collaborative learning activities. © 2021 British Educational Research Association","John Wiley and Sons Inc",00071013,,BJETD,"Br J Educ Technol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107605080

Project evaluation consists of the following phases: documentation, presentation, teamwork, and leadership. This study has used the entire duration of the project assessment process for the evaluation of personality changes along with the academic assessment for the duration of 2 years. The intervention used for the evaluation is strongly correlated with five factors (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) of the OCEAN model. Statistical and descriptive tests are used for the assessment of the relationship of interventions on academic performance, personality development, and placement activity with 95% confidence. The survey has been conducted at the end of 2 years to validate the obtained results on the basis of interventions. From the results, it has been found that students can actually work upon personality enhancement till the 7th semester whereas the improvement in learning and analytical skills is a continuous process and the students in the 8th semester have shown significant variation in these two assessed parameters. Thus, the proposed intervention approach is an appropriate tool, which helps students to improve their personality at five factors of the OCEAN model results in 360° enhancement in the personality along with academic performance. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC","John Wiley and Sons Inc",10613773,,CAPEE,"Comput Appl Eng Educ",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103208016

In the spring of 2021, five EPS@ISEP students from distinct countries and fields of study joined efforts to address the smart and sustainable food production issue. This paper reports their research and development of Wormify, a solution based on vermicomposting. The main goal of the project was to design, simulate, test and build a prototype following ethical and sustainable practices. Wormify aims to minimize the problem of feeding the growing global population, and to prevent food waste from going to landfills. These objectives were pursued by designing a smart modular system for urban rooftops or small balconies. Several modules can be connected to form a place for residents to meet and socialize. The smart system allows monitoring through an app/website.

The objectives were to understand how students approach this complex, open-ended problem of planning their collaborative process and then identify strategies for improving their process through a plan-do-check-act cycle and reflecting on the applicability of industry standards. Design/methodology/approach: The authors present a longitudinal case study based on qualitative data from the 3 consecutive years of teaching a senior undergraduate course in a construction engineering program. Findings: The findings offer a rich picture of how students approached this collaborative process and emphasize the complex nature of teaching BIM as information management process. The authors present instances of how students made sense of BIM standards through applied experience. The findings also demonstrate the value of an outcome-based approach whereby knowledge is gained through an iterative plan-do-check-act cycle. Here, the BEP and model deliverables served only as vehicles to test and apply a range of skills by making them more explicit. Practical implications: The research contributes to the literature on mechanisms that support students in planning, managing and improving collaborative information strategies in a BIM context. Specifically, the authors illustrate a tension in how to pedagogically deploy industry-oriented process planning methods to establish relevance for students in order to effectively engage in interdisciplinary teams. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors argue that teaching students how to plan, design and enact effective BIM collaboration information delivery is firmly nested within pedagogical management and communication skills. The authors illustrate with examples how students make sense of BIM approaches by making them concrete and meaningful to their own experience. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.",09699988,,,"Eng.

A total of 215 first-year undergraduate students in medical, dentistry, and nutrition programs participated in this pre-post quasi experimental study. The students attended a typical face-to-face lecture on Day-1 of the intervention, followed by a CLT-based online lecture 8 weeks thereafter. Their comprehension of the lecture topics was measured through pre- and post-lecture assessments, and their cognitive load, cognitive engagement, and motivation were measured immediately after each lecture session. The analysis revealed that the CLT-based online lectures promoted the students' comprehension of the lecture content (p < 0.001), self-perceived learning (p < 0.001), engagement toward the learning material, and motivation to learn (p = 0.025). It was also effective at reducing the students' intrinsic and extraneous cognitive loads (p < 0.001). Hence, designing online lectures using CLT and CTML principles could be an effective method to promote students' knowledge and comprehension, cognitive engagement, and learning motivation. However, further research is needed to investigate the applicability and impact of CLT-based online lectures in non-health profession disciplines. © Copyright © 2021 Hadie, Tan, Omar, Nik Mohd Alwi, Lim and Ku Marsilla.","Frontiers Media S.A.",2296858X,,,"Front.

As nurse anesthesia programs (NAPs) transition to DNP entry into practice, management of DNP projects has been identified as a major challenge facing nursing faculty. Also, adequate mentorship has been identified as a crucial part of doctorate education. Despite the absence of literature on team mentorship in nursing, many NAPs are opting for DNP team projects and group mentoring. In team DNP projects, the mentors foster professionalism, establish the ground rules for communication, resolve conflict, and provide expert knowledge. Effective implementation of projects can enhance relational learning and teamwork, which are essential for a successful career in healthcare. Additionally, mentoring teams can simultaneously improve the professional growth of junior faculty, reduce the faculty workload, and improve the quality of DNP projects.

As such, many university educators strive to help their students to collaborate effectively. However, it is typically the case that more than ad-hoc experience is needed to master teamwork. Often, students need to become reflective practitioners who learn from their experiences and enact change. Self and peer evaluation can help evoke such reflection. However, the facilitating conditions for effective learning from peer evaluation during group projects in computing are not yet well-defined. This research is an initial step in identifying these conditions. In this study, students engaged in a long-term multidisciplinary software engineering project in which they produced a digital game. They completed regular exercises in which they reflected upon and wrote about their contributions to the project as well as those of their peers. Thematic analysis of 200 responses to an open-ended question about the purpose of these exercises illustrated student perspectives: giving and receiving feedback; prompting personal reflection and improvement; supporting supervision; aiding marking; informing project planning and management; exploring and reshaping group dynamics; improving project outputs; providing a system to hold group members accountable; and giving a sense of safety to raise issues without repercussion. Giving consideration to these differing perceptions will help educators to address student concerns about group projects, notably standardisation, workload efficiency, and fairness, and will lay the foundations for a model of peer evaluation which improves teamwork. © 2021 ACM.","Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450385688,,"ACM Int.

The main reason is that the com-plexity and geometry concept is not very concrete in real world. On the other hand, for communication education, organizing a well-formed news express is also an important lecture topic. Nevertheless, it is known that studying 3D modeling technique is challenging. Most of the communication students have limited prior-knowledge about archi-tectures, 3D concept, and mathematics. Cognition of the 2D and 3D space forms the fundamental basis of the design activities. Many opened courses started from 2D image design/processing and then mentioned the 3D space concept before 3D modeling lectures by follows. News-based illustration is quite common seen in many lectures and administration topics. To engaging studying, in this paper we design a novel lecture administration strategy that combines social activity and project-based learning as to develop news express in presentation. In the social activity, students are required to collect feedback and try to demonstrate to people online. In teaching project goal, learners work together and learn to establish big project as team work. In the final stage, each group should accomplish the news express design within 2 hours and publishing to social Web site. The proposed teaching strategy had been applied in real university course in two years. The empirical result showed that learners not only immersive in doing project, but also sub-stantially improves the 3D modeling capability in course. The result of the satisfactory quiz shows that the teaching strategy is highly positive for learning. © 2021, Tamkang University.

In online learning systems, students’ learning can be tracked and examined based on data collected by the systems themselves. However, it is non-trivial to decide how to extract the desired students’ behavior from the limited data in traditional classroom courses. Software development courses are a domain where student behavior analysis would be especially useful, as continuous teaching improvement in this fast progressing domain is necessary. In this paper, we propose to use process mining for improvement-motivated process analysis of a software development course (web development in particular). To this end, we analyze Git logs of students’ projects to understand their development processes. Process mining has been chosen as it can help us to find a descriptive model of this process. The main contribution of this paper is the detailed methodology of process mining usage for students’ project development analysis, considering various commit characteristics, which are crucial in understanding student coding-behavior patterns. The process mining analysis proved to be very useful, indicating multiple directions for the course improvement, which we also include in this work as a secondary contribution. The third contribution of this work is the summary and discussion of the process mining advantages and current gaps in process mining research for this task.

Despite affordances and product semantics being taught in some design educations, many designers in industry do not explicitly consider affordances nor product semantics during the design process. This is partly due to the lack of a framework that supports the considerations for affordances and product semantics during the design process. As a consequence, many designers rely on their own intuition, and this can be problematic. To avoid the potential negative effects of relying on intuition, we designed a framework to support the designer in explicitly considering affordances and applying product semantics during product design. This framework was used by undergraduate students in product design engineering during a 12-week product design assignment. In this paper we present the framework, examples of how it was used and how it was evaluated by the students.

This has presented many new challenges for lecturers and students, especially for online interactions and working remotely in teams which is not an uncommon practice in design and media industry. This study investigates how the use of character-based gamification for design team formation can help lecturers to address the problems of teamwork among design and media students as well as the new emerging challenges in online collaborative environments. In this gamified learning intervention, the personality, roles and abilities of students' chosen game characters were used by the lecturers as references and insights to form teams for collaborative design projects. The data for the study is based on the teamwork experiences of 47 design and media students at a tertiary arts institution in Singapore. These students undertook team projects in no character assigned teams, random characters assigned teams, and characters matched teams assigned by matching students with the personalities, roles, and abilities of their chosen game characters. The results indicate that students' perception of online teamwork experience was most positive when working in teams matched with game characters.

There is even a fair amount of scientific evidence that starting early is beneficial for learning. In this work, we investigate students' time management behavior in a second-year project-based software engineering course. In the course, students work on a software project in small groups of four to six students. We study time management from multiple angles. Firstly, we conduct an exploratory factor analysis and study how different time management related behavioral metrics are related to one another, for example, whether individual students' time management practices in the second-year group project-based course are similar to their earlier time management practices in first-year courses where students work on assignments individually. Understanding how students' previous time management behavior is manifested in later project-based courses would be beneficial when designing project-based education. Secondly, we study whether students' time management practices affect the peer-review scores they get from their group members. Lastly, we explore how time management affects course performance. Our findings suggest that time management behavior, even from courses taken in the past, can be used to predict how students perform in future courses. © 2021 ACM.","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450383264,,"ICER - Proc.

Analyzing the source code contributions during the projects’ development could provide both instructors and students with constant feedback to identify common trends and behaviors that can be improved during the courses. Evaluating course projects is a challenge due to the difficulty of measuring individual student contributions versus team contributions during the development. The adoption of distributed version control systems like git enables the measurement of students’ and teams’ contributions to the project. In this work, we analyze the contributions within eight software development projects, with 150 students in total, from undergraduate courses that used project-based learning. We generate visualizations of aggregated git metrics using inequality measures and the contribution per module, offering insights into the practices and processes followed by students and teams throughout the project development. This approach allowed us to identify inequality among students’ contributions, the modules where students contributed, development processes with a non-steady pace, and integration practices rendering a useful feedback tool for instructors and students during the project’s development. Further studies can be conducted to assess the quality, complexity, and ownership of the contributions by analyzing software artifacts.

This work aims to contribute to the discussion on teachers’ pedagogical competences required for active learning. This contribution is developed from the perceptions of 205 engineering teachers of Brazilian higher education institutions, centered on significant teaching competences necessary for teachers of engineering courses and how to develop them in the active learning context. The results show that essential competences identified by the participants are (I) teamwork (teachers’ cooperation); (II) teacher–student relationships (empathy); (III) feedback about students’ performance throughout the learning process; (IV) information and communication technology (ICT) competences; (V) selecting and adapting the teaching-learning methodologies to the class context; and (VI) creativity. A complementary logistic regression model suggested that female Ph.D. full-time teachers are more likely to employ active learning. Differences in active learning adoption among Brazilian regions were also captured by the model. The identified competences are essential for the sustainability of the innovation of teaching practices in the context of active learning, which may be used to inform more effective professional training of engineering teachers in the current globalized scenario. © 2021 by the authors.

Literature states that e-assessment tools need to consider restrictions in the students' distribution of scores during the self and peer assessment.

To attain this goal, a study was carried out to analyze students’ perceptions about Scrum as an effective method for PBL teams. Based on two different editions of PBL that used the Scrum method with different characteristics in each approach, this paper aims to identify the best practices for effective team and project management and draw recommendations for successful use of scrum in PBL approaches. The authors used an exploratory case study carried out within an engineering program at the University of Minho, Portugal. The research design was based on an explorative quantitative and qualitative approach. Implementing Scrum in PBL teams helps students to keep the project running smoothly and draws greater awareness on how to manage the project and teams in a more effective way. Findings show that task assignment, performance monitoring, visual management and regular feedback were considered the main advantages of using Scrum in PBL teams, which had a positive impact on student performance. However, for the success of Scrum, students recognize the role of the Scrum Master and Project Owner as vital to guide the teams in a sustainable way. Research on the application of Scrum in Education is scarce and mostly exploratory. This paper is among the very few empirical studies consolidating knowledge on the implementation of Scrum approaches to improve learning in higher education. More specifically, it brings a valuable contribution on how to improve specifically team performance in PBL teams with the use of agile approaches such as Scrum. © 2021 by the authors.

Several implementation challenges are associated with project-based learning. Among these challenges is ensuring collaboration between students enrolled in a project assignment. The purpose of this study was to present several practical insights on how to tackle collaboration challenges in project-based learning. The study is based on the qualitative analysis of 67 reflections reports submitted by students who were enrolled in a project-based learning assignment in engineering education. The results suggest that collaboration challenges can be traced to priority conflicts between students as well as to the uncertainty in the project assignment. The results further suggest that these challenges can be successfully addressed by applying a structured project-management approach to planning, communication, and follow up. In addition, the findings suggest this structured approached should be supported by a mindset that recognizes the importance of adaptations and flexibility as the project develops.

Four project-based engineering undergraduate teams were audiotaped in collaborative tasks (7514 talk turns). Discourse was coded for regulation processes and types (self and socially shared regulation), and analyzed with Epistemic Network Analysis and Process Mining. We find that teams who reported more frequent social exchange engaged in shared regulation together with planning and monitoring more frequently, while teams with less exchange engaged in long durations of collaboration. Furthermore, students in teams with more engaged regulation reported enhanced beliefs in group efficacy to solve collaborative tasks.

Background: PBL is defined as an instructional method of constructivist teaching that uses real problems as a motivating element for learning. Although PBL was born in medical education, it has been used in computing education to facilitate the students' engagement and learning capacity, contributing to developing skills, such as teamwork, holistic vision, critical thinking, and solving problem. Considering that approach much more descriptive than prescriptive, it favors the implementation of diverse methodologies on its behalf. Research Question: 'How the PBL approach has been applied in teaching computing?' Methodology: From the initial set of 3837 studies, 102 primary studies were selected and categorized through Kitchenham methodology for analysis from 1999 to 2019. Findings: Based on these studies, it was possible to verify a greater adoption of PBL in undergraduate education and a great diversity of strategies involving real-world problems, developing technical and no-technical skills and making the student much more motivated and engaged.

HyFlex, short for hybrid-flexibility, is a teaching model where instructors and students have the option to attend scheduled courses face-to-face (F2F) or remotely. In this teaching model the learning outcomes for the course remain the same for all who enroll regardless of the mode of attendance. Our HyFlex SQA approach consists of lectures (in class, with video recordings), face-to-face activities, as well as group assignments, group projects, and exams all facilitated through an online campus management system. During the lecture period, the instructor delivers content in the form of lecture slides and writing on a whiteboard. This poses significant challenges for the instructor, as the learning outcomes have to be delivered in different modalities, but with the same quality. This is particularly difficult in SQA courses, as these require instruction in formal methods as well as systematic justification of engineering choices, both of which are best facilitated in F2F fashion that implement Think-Pair-Share (TPS) amongst students. TPS is an active learning technique in which students are allocated adequate time to think individually on a task posed by the instructor, followed by pair discussions, and then as a class discussion. The task given by the instructor is of similar complexity to that which is covered as an example during lecture. Online synchronous activities involve students participating in TPS by working collaboratively as a group on tasks that correspond with concepts covered in the slide-based lectures. This way students learn from each other by thinking individually then sharing ideas in the classroom, thus contributing to better understanding of course content. For assignments and projects students are allocated a portion of the class time to meet with group members and discuss their activities. Groups also have the option to ask the instructor questions aloud that will help other groups to complete their assignments and projects successfully. Delivering these in a hybrid format was required during the fall of 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions. The results show that while performance in projects and homework assignments remained constant, final exam performance was significantly (p < 0.05) lower in 2020 compared to previous course offerings. We also noted a lower enrollment, higher participatory effort on both instructors and students, and a subjectively decreased feeling of collaboration. Nevertheless, students rated their perceived learning experience as high and regard HyFlex learning facilities as adequate. In this paper we adopted a HyFlex teaching model that incorporates reduced F2F seating, educational tools such as Blackboard, Panopto, Zoom, Google docs, and Discord. We conclude by discussing some challenges experienced with HyFlex teaching model and recommendations for adopting the teaching model by other instructors who teach CS courses that involve a considerable amount of group activities. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021","American Society for Engineering Education",21535965,,,"ASEE Annu.

Hands-on activities challenge their creativity, problem-solving, and critical thinking. Beyond that, labs are an ideal platform for developing teamwork and communication. In normal circumstances, providing quality lab experiences can be resource intensive and logistically challenging, particularly for large class sizes. This year, new safety measures required by Covid-19 have completely changed the equation, adding constraints few of us could have anticipated a year ago. One solution to the Covid-19 puzzle is remote learning; this might involve video demonstration of experiments, simulations, and/or 'at home' experiments. Another option is to continue to offer in-person labs with added safety measures to include mask wearing, social distancing, and enhanced cleaning. For the Fall 2020 thermal-fluids laboratory course at the University of Virginia (UVA), a hybrid model was adopted. Students were given the option to take the class 100% remotely, or they could attend lab in person every other week. During the second week of the semester, entire sections met online for team forming. Though some attempt was made to group in-person students in the same team, several teams had a mix of in-person and remote students. The curriculum was redesigned into two-week blocks. During the 'on' week, students collected data from an experiment they performed in person or watched virtually. During the 'off' week, they worked in teams on various activities including report peer review workshops, a team project, and post-processing of the previous week's experiments. This paper will discuss how the course design fostered team development in the hybrid learning environment. Metrics from each mode of delivery: in-person and remote, are assessed. These will include performance on individual and team assignments, and team member peer evaluations via Comprehensive Assessment of Team Member Effectiveness (CATME) evaluations. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021","American Society for Engineering Education",21535965,,,"ASEE Annu.

These projects entail complex technical facets and face challenges due to scheduling concerns, budget constraints, conflicting viewpoints, or performance issues. To prepare engineering students for the real-world, faculty assign students to teams. However, there are varying levels of commitment and skills regarding effective teamwork among students. To address this disparity, the faculty developed a student regulated learning reflection (SLR) assignment which asks each student to define leadership and teamwork, to complete a confidential peer-evaluation by assessing each team member's performance and answering a psychological safety questionnaire. The criteria looked at leadership, collaboration and inclusivity, responsibility, work quality, meeting deadlines, and communication. First, each student shares their opinion regarding each criterion through a SLR, where faculty review their reflections and provide instruction to improve gaps associated with leadership and teamwork. At the completion of the group project, students evaluate their teams' performance in each criterion using a Likert scale survey. Finally, each student responds to a series of questions in order to evaluate the psychological safety of the team. The results from the SLR, confidential peer-evaluation, and psychological safety questionnaire assisted faculty in evaluating team performance and implement instructional strategies to improve teamwork.

A locally-relevant, project-based learning experience was provided to all first year engineering students (N = 91) at Ashesi University in Ghana. Pre and post surveys were administered to understand changes in students' self-efficacy as a result of the intervention. The project scope was to design, build, and fly a quadcopter drone to simulate surveying a mining area in Zimbabwe and transporting items between two sites. This scope was significantly more challenging than anything most of them had done before, as evidenced by less than half of the students reporting prior experience designing and building any product, and nearly a third describing the project as “impossible” at first. Significant (p < 1.04 E-2) increases with medium to large effect sizes (|g| = 0.653 to 1.427) were measured for five of six self-efficacy measures, capturing how students' belief in their own abilities increased as a result of the intervention. The effect size of the increase was largest for those students with no prior experience in fabrication. The intervention had no to small effect size on students' aspirations for how they will use engineering, suggesting that stronger connections should be made to the broader implications of the skills they are acquiring. Some of the top challenges expressed by students shifted from inward-facing ones (such as negative self-perceptions and doubts in their own abilities) to those commonly experienced in group projects (such as teamwork and troubleshooting), providing another indication of increase in self-efficacy. Despite the level of complexity of the project, the top emotions expressed by students upon completion of the project were pride and joy. The use of responsive pedagogy should be further refined in the African context, mechanisms for building self-efficacy in young African engineers should be elicited, and they should be considered equally alongside interventions focused on improving learning outcomes. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021","American Society for Engineering Education",21535965,,,"ASEE Annu.

With several transitions to virtual course delivery and/or hybrid models of learning, capstone faculty are now challenged with helping students meet project objectives and deliverables, fostering student team cohesion, and managing sponsor expectations in virtual settings, all while fulfilling the course learning outcomes. While there have been countless programs, communities, and support systems implemented to guide the transition to online teaching, initially there was very little available to systematically understand and support the capstone and PBL community. The objectives of this work are twofold. The first aim is to outline the challenges faced by capstone faculty due to transitions to primarily remote capstone offerings, particularly within the areas of managing sponsorship, completing projects, and producing the associated final project deliverables. The second objective is to open a dialogue to chronicle concerns, gather input, and share best practices across the broader capstone community. The overarching goal is to help overcome -and even rise to- these challenges. This research was conducted by capstone faculty at four different universities. The first phase of this initiative involved research to identify the issues and practices in the existing literature, especially relevant to virtual capstone offerings. The second phase of this research involved a survey of capstone faculty on this topic to reinforce and/or supplement the literature findings as the virtual circumstances evolved. To understand the acute challenges, the survey noted above was conducted with the broader capstone community to include a diversity of faculty associated with capstone at a variety of institutions. This included capstone directors, coordinators, instructors, and advisors. The third phase gathered information through a panel organized and conducted by the authors at the most recent ASEE conference while dealing with societal and academic COVID-19 restrictions. The ASEE panel served as a platform to bring together the capstone community for ongoing dialogue, supplying additional solution recommendations. Results from this research coupled with literature findings indicated the commonality of challenges faced by capstone programs regardless of timing, engineering major, program profile, or type of institution. Among the survey results were the following: (1) Due to COVID-19 conditions, 44% of the respondents reported complete cancellation of this event while 56% reported conducting some form of virtual exposition. The work represented in this paper supports an intention to be agile enough to adapt to any situation along this continuum - and likewise be posed to adjust when our capstone programs must react to emerging circumstances in the future. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021","American Society for Engineering Education",21535965,,,"ASEE Annu.

However, “soft skills” such as teamwork is also an essential skill in engineering curricula. Generally, it is common for engineering courses to contain team-based projects ranging from first-year Introduction to Engineering courses to Senior Design/Capstone courses. However, students' experiences in teams vary greatly and when un-facilitated within large courses, students may have negative experiences which impact their future learning. To overcome this issue, a new course: Applications in Project Management in Biomedical Engineering was developed at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. This course is student-led where upper-class students serve as project managers (PMs) to first-year student teams in Introduction to Biomedical Engineering who are conducting semester long design projects. The upper-class students learn about a promising career in engineering project management while immersed in their role as PMs. They are responsible for setting agendas, ensuring quality of deliverables, setting deadlines, and managing conflicts. Several studies have revealed that in industry, the role project managers take have significant impact on project success [1], [2] and that teamwork was positively correlated with project performance. Project success can be achieved with stronger collaboration, team cohesiveness, and team communication [1]. However, project management is rarely discussed or taught in undergraduate engineering programs. In this paper, we analyze how upper-class PMs influence first-year students' perceptions on team dynamics and stress as they go through their semester long design project. Half of the first-year students worked with upper-class PMs (PM group) and half worked traditionally in teams without PMs (Control group) as in previous years. At the end of the semester, a survey was conducted to study the students' perceptions on self-efficacy, confidence, teamwork, and stress. Survey consisted of 5-point Likert scale questions and analyzed with student's T-test. No significant differences were observed on students' self-efficacy, confidence, and stress when the course was taught both virtually and face-to face. However, statistically significant changes were observed when analyzing students' perceptions of teamwork in a face-to-face environment. This included higher ratings when asked about how well the group worked together (p=0.013), about whether the group had similar expectations (0.009), and about whether students supported each other (p=0.019). Further analysis showed that there were significant differences as reported by female and male students. Interestingly, while similar trends were observed when the course was conducted virtually, the data was not significant. Our data shows that incorporation of upper-level project managers in first-year courses can aid in their perceptions of team-based learning and that students with PMs worked better within their teams. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021","American Society for Engineering Education",21535965,,,"ASEE Annu.

Students will have access to paid on-campus work experiences and internships in businesses and industries. It is anticipated that some examples of potential student projects include mobile application development, cybersecurity, and computer support. It is expected that these experiences will increase undergraduate student interest, persistence, and success in computer information systems, as well as in STEM more broadly. To ensure that they are well-prepared for and gain the most from their work experiences, students will receive training on employability skills such as communication, teamwork, and project management. In addition, during their work experiences, students will be mentored by faculty, industry professionals, and peers. To strengthen the capacity of faculty to serve all students, including Hispanic students, the project will provide faculty with professional development focused on an equity mindset. This framework to provide mentored work experiences will be developed and piloted at Phoenix College, in the computer information technology department and eventually expanded to other STEM fields at the institution. Following this, the project also intends to expand this framework to four other two-year HSIs in the region. Through this work, the project aims to develop a replicable model for how two-year institutions can develop work experiences that foster increased student graduation and entry into STEM career pathways. This project, which is currently in its first year, seeks to examine how a curriculum that integrates cross-sector partnerships to provide work experiences can enhance STEM learning and retention. Using mixed methods and grounded theory, the project will expand knowledge about: (1) the impact of cross-sector partnerships that support work-focused experiential teaching and learning; (2) systematic ways to maintain and better use cross-sector partnerships; and (3) the degree to which a model of work-focused learning experiences can be adopted at other two-year HSIs and by other STEM fields. Baseline data about Hispanic serving identity at the pilot institution has been collected and assessed at the institutional, departmental, and for different educator roles including faculty, support staff, and administrative leaders to produce inputs towards developing a detailed plan of action. Early results from baseline data, visualizations, planning responses, and initial project activities for student work experiences and faculty professional development will be reported in the submission. The impact of Covid-19 to Year 1 activities will also be discussed. Expected long term results of the project include: development of sustainable mechanisms to foster cross-sector partnerships; increased student retention and workforce readiness; and measurable successes for STEM students, particularly Hispanic students, at two-year HSIs. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021","American Society for Engineering Education",21535965,,,"ASEE Annu.

This particularly is true for senior capstone design, where students focus their attention on a single design prompt for up to three consecutive semesters. We hypothesized that students possess a natural inclination towards types of capstone projects, and their choice of a project may impact their motivation levels throughout their experience in the design course, which ultimately will impact their performance. While educators have made attempts to influence specific motivational factors to improve student performance, the interdependency of motivation factors as they change is unknown. This paper examines the correlation and the interdependency between student motivation factors. Using the MSLQ questionnaire by Pintrich, we examine five factors of motivation: cognition, self-regulation, intrinsic value, test anxiety, and self-efficacy. In this study, two cohorts of senior capstone design students completed the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) to self-evaluate their motivation on a 7-point Likert scale at two instances (beginning and end of senior capstone design course). The study is performed through a two-fold analysis: Covariance/Correlations and Principal Component Analysis. A principal component analysis indicated that each of the factors uniformly captured the variation in the data - an indication of a well-designed instrument. However, the results of the study also indicated that motivation factors do possess correlation with one another (except for anxiety, which displayed no correlation with two factors and low correlation with the remaining factors). The results indicate that changes to one factor by an educator may unintentionally make changes to other factors that may have an unanticipated net effect on their motivational level. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021","American Society for Engineering Education",21535965,,,"ASEE Annu.

The institution-specific leadership model developed at The Citadel prepares students for leadership through teamed challenges and projects, positioning the engineering program to provide robust learning experiences for students. Reinforced in multiple senior-level capstone design courses and a sophomore-level, engineering-specific communications course, students were asked to assess leadership performance during team-based projects. Both sophomore-level communications courses and senior-level design courses used this framework, and students provided Likert-scale survey responses. Student responses include both peer and self-assessments, and they were trained in the use of this instrument in other leader development instruction. All students must learn, experience, and internalize the leadership model over four years. The leadership program further describes individual leadership characteristics, and all students are assessed on their leader development against these characteristics. This instrument reinforces the mission of The Citadel, embedding a character development instrument traditionally emphasized in required leadership studies courses. Further, regular surveying with this instrument resulted in improved teamwork, interaction, and performance for some students. Iterative survey results over four semesters include normalized individual scores, which have been shown to be an effective way to differentiate varying levels of contributed effort among team members. This research presents an application of this leadership development framework, assessed within senior-level engineering capstone design courses and a sophomore-level communications course. While the leadership framework is specific to The Citadel, results indicate that iterative surveying works as a priming mechanism, reinforcing good leadership practices in teams. Additionally, the normalization of scores, as presented here, is an effective way to quantify individual-level effort, and the practice is supported in the literature on STEM-focused approaches to assessment. Findings are intended to be of interest to other undergraduate engineering programs working to enhance teamwork and leadership experiences through assessment-based methods. This paper also offers a comparison to the leadership models in the military and other selected undergraduate institutions with a leadership component in the curriculum. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021","American Society for Engineering Education",21535965,,,"ASEE Annu.

This rapid transition online and transformation of team projects presented a unique opportunity to study team dynamics, specifically communication challenges, within virtual team projects. For most students, the 2020 spring semester was the first time they had to complete a virtual team project; however, with the rise in remote work in industry, many students will have jobs that include virtual work on teams. As such, investigating the communication challenges undergraduate engineering students experienced provides important insights to guide classroom instruction and tips for students working on virtual teams. Furthermore, this work has the potential to improve both virtual and in-person team project designs and increase the impact of team projects on the education of engineering undergraduate students by encouraging effective communication. We collected open-ended survey responses and conducted interviews with a range of engineering majors and class standing. We analyzed the data with a conventional qualitative content approach allowing for the development of emergent codes. Throughout the coding process, inter-rater reliability (IRR) quantitatively assessed the coding agreement across researchers until the IRR was higher than 80% for each coding category and the overall IRR across all categories was higher than 90%. The data from the interviews showed students perceived poorer team communication in the virtual environment, limiting team's effectiveness in completing tasks. Students mentioned that the environment had negative effects on the collaboration and relationship formation of the group members. Some students described strategies they adapted for improving communication, including approaches for establishing clear expectations, streamlining meetings, and building trust. Results indicate that designing a meeting structure with thorough planning documentation that designates time for social interactions to foster trust between team members is a powerful method for encouraging effective communication and overall project success. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021","American Society for Engineering Education",21535965,,,"ASEE Annu.

Contemporary pedagogical approaches, such as problem-based learning and entrepreneurially minded learning, have as a central focus the desire to expose students to authentic experiences which integrate technical knowledge with workplace skills connected to professionalism, communication, collaboration, and leadership. This approach can conflict with traditional engineering curricula where the instruction of technical skills are frequently separated or deemed more important than “soft skills” instruction in interpersonal, professional, and technical communication. Acknowledging that this divide persists in engineering education, this paper reports on an ongoing study of industry and academic expectations for engineering students' professional communication to present the development and implementation of embedded professional communication topics in an engineering curricula. In prior work, observational data from interviews with human resource personnel, managers, and focus groups of early-career engineers at five companies of regional and national status reported on the genres commonly used in the workplace. The status of professional and interpersonal communication instruction was assessed in the current mechanical and civil engineering program curriculums at the University of Dayton, a mid-sized, private university in the Midwestern United States. Results indicated incongruities between current curricula and the expectations of industry partners in the areas of professional and interpersonal communication. This paper provides an overview of the development and implementation of two project-based assignments that address recommendations from industry partners within an integrative pedagogical approach that brings technical knowledge from engineering technology together with human-centered rhetorical knowledge from technical communication. Specifically, we report on the process of creating, implementing, and initial observations in evaluating a Specification Design Review assignment and a Heat Transfer Analysis assignment - two separate technical communication activities in different courses within an engineering technology program.

Our institution runs a first year introduction to engineering course with approximately 200 students that uses team projects over the span of the semester. Each project has 2-5 students per team and incorporates peer and self evaluations into each student's individual project grades. The researchers began this study to observe how racial, gender, and self-bias impact these peer evaluations. Peer evaluations are often employed in instances of group work, particularly in the undergraduate setting. These peer evaluations can present important information regarding team dynamic and distribution of workload. However, this method of assessment is also susceptible to both explicit and implicit biases, specifically in regard to race, gender, and self-bias. After identifying possible biases in our peer evaluation procedure, the researchers plan to examine methods to mitigate these biases. For each project, students submitted peer evaluations of themselves and each of their team members. The peer evaluations required the students to split 100 points amongst all team members including themselves with an optional written rationale for scores. The 1725 peer evaluation scores collected by this study were double-key entered into a database. Participants were also asked to self-identify as one of 6 gender options and 8 race options. If participants selected multiple races, they were assigned to the less common one. Two generalized linear regression models (GLMs) were used, one to estimate self-bias within each race/gender group (i.e. whether students give higher scores to themselves), and one to estimate how members in each race/gender group scored members of other groups, excluding the self-scores. Model coefficients significantly different from zero at the p<0.05 level indicated differences between groups and therefore possible evidence of biases. There were 160 participants, all of whom identified as either male or female. Due to small numbers, participants were combined into 3 race categories (White, Asian, or 'Other') for a total of 6 race/gender groups. Results showed that the students were significantly more likely to give themselves a higher score than other students on average, even after accounting for race/gender. This self-bias was consistent in both genders. White males gave scores to Other males that were significantly lower than what they gave to all other groups and significantly lower than what Other males received from White females or Asian males. This suggests a possible negative bias from White males to Other males. Similarly, Asian males gave scores to Other males and Other females that were significantly higher than what they gave to all other groups and significantly higher that what Other males and Other females received from all other groups.

Speed Measurement setup had been developed for demonstration in theory, laboratories and project demos for academia in measurements & instrumentation courses. A traditional measurement setup-Stroboscope that is commonly used for demonstration in laboratories is presented to serve as a base for comparison. The proposed speed measurement for laboratory is envisioned based on counting the number of state changes of a sensing switch. Different approaches and possibilities are discussed that could be implemented in student's education. This approach is aimed at increasing knowledge, skill levels of students and help in using theoretical knowledge for application to practical & real-world problems. It also presents opportunities in instilling design thinking, skill development, integration and team work. Models based on only Software and ones that include hardware are presented for simulation & actual measurement.

This paper introduces the construct of temporal brokerage, which we define as being in a position within a team's temporal structure that bridges subgroups that have little or no temporal overlap with each other. Although temporal brokerage is not a formal role, we argue that occupying such a position makes an individual more likely to take on more coordination work than other members on the team. We suggest that, while engaging in such coordination work has advantages in the form of enhanced integrative complexity, it also comes with costs in the form of a greater workload relative to other members. We further argue that the increased integrative complexity and workload that result from occupying a position of temporal brokerage have implications that go beyond the boundaries of the focal team, spilling over into other projects the individual is engaged in. Specifically, we predict that being in positions of temporal brokerage on global teams decreases the quantity but increases the quality of an individual's total productive output. We find support for these predictions across two studies comprising 4,553 individuals participating in global student project teams and 123,586 individuals participating in global academic research teams, respectively. The framework and findings presented in this paper contribute to theories of global teamwork, pivotal roles and leadership emergence in global teams, and social network theory.

Reducing the likelihood of such issues requires proper preparation for software engineering students during their undergraduate studies to reduce the gap between theory and practice. Students must develop the soft skills that are needed to practice software engineering activities, especially requirements engineering. Accordingly, encouraging students to learn and practice requirements engineering concepts and activities are required. Students undertake the requirements engineering course in one semester, where the lecturer focuses on delivering the theoretical concepts to students which creates teacher-centred learning. It is difficult for students to develop the required critical thinking and communication skills that enable them to solve real-world problems in such a teacher-centred environment. This study uses Project-Based Learning (PBL), Social Networking Sites (SNSs) and cloud enhanced communication to design a non-traditional teaching approach to improve students’ learning and to achieve a learner-centred learning environment in a requirements engineering course. The developed approach was applied to a requirements engineering course at our university to investigate its effectiveness and its impact on students’ learning ability. The students in the investigational group learned with the new method; however, the students in the control group learned with the traditional learning method.

Therefore, self and peer assessment are becoming a common practice in academic institutions. With the technology evolution and the emerging of assessment software tools, the evaluators' work is becoming easier. This paper presents seven different tools, as well as their features and functionalities. To evaluate and compare these tools, some parameters are presented and described, based on usability and user experience definitions.

While transfer of responsibility is considered as an ultimate goal in scaffolding that is adaptive and contingent, it is rarely studied and practiced. Thus, the purpose of this study was to inform a deeper understanding of one middle school teacher’s manner of soft scaffolding, which refers to just-in-time and contingent support, through teacher-student interaction to examine how transfer of responsibility was achieved. We investigated one middle school teacher’s forms of scaffolding during a problem of food systems and supply chains related multiple aspects of sustainability and social justice issues.

This is particularly apparent in the manufacturing industry, as the integration of new manufacturing system technology requires knowledge in a diverse set of fields, such as physics, computer science, and engineering, to name a few. To properly educate the next workforce in manufacturing, engineering education needs to incorporate cross-disciplinary, project-driven learning that provides students with ample opportunities to work with cutting-edge manufacturing technology. At the University of Michigan, the Secure Cloud Manufacturing Multidisciplinary Design Program team focuses on developing the next generation of manufacturing engineers through research-driven multidisciplinary projects. A group of 7-22 students work on several multisemester-long projects that focus on providing hands-on, student-driven learning. Each semester, these students work closely with several faculty members, research scientists, postdocs, and graduate students to propose, develop, and conduct industry-relevant research projects on multiple manufacturing testbeds. Example projects have included the implementation of a smart quality-control camera, the development of digital twins for manufacturing processes, and the integration of secure cloud-based infrastructures for industrial controllers. In these highly collaborative and multidisciplinary project groups, students learn from each other, take on leadership roles, and disseminate their work through technical reports and presentations to academic and industry experts. Students leave the group with an understanding of the capabilities and needs of future manufacturing systems, ready to become, and lead, the next set of manufacturing engineers.

Working on real projects also supports students to acquire leadership skills, such as communication, project management, and teamwork. This paper describes a case study integrating students from different Software Engineering programs and involving external stakeholders, underpinned by PBL concepts. We present how this study was designed and implemented in a large institution, in four steps, summarized as follows: (I) requirements gathering and design; (II) information system development and implementation; (III) integration tests and deployment process; (IV) support and maintenance activities.

The discipline of computing education is especially interesting in this context, because some of its specific features (such as the variation in entry skill level and the use of source code repositories as collaboration platforms) are likely to influence the approach taken within groupwork. The aim of this research is to gain insight into the work division and allocation strategies applied by computer science students during group assignments. To this end, we interviewed twenty students of four universities. The thematic analysis shows that students tend to divide up the workload to enable working independently, with pair programming and code reviews being often employed. Motivated primarily by grade and efficiency factors, students choose and allocate tasks primarily based on their prior expertise and preferences. Based on our findings, we argue that the setup of group assignments can limit students' motivation for practicing new software engineering skills, and that interventions are needed towards encouraging experimentation and learning. © 2021 IEEE.","IEEE Computer Society",02705257,9780738133201,PCSED,"Proc Int Conf Software Eng",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85115618611

It engages the learner in critical thinking, fosters introspection, improves retention, and enables generalization of concepts to new engineering situations. However, as projects often focus on software construction, students tend to adopt third-party technologies without critical reflection. Such insufficient supply chain risk management (SCRM) throughout the project then threatens learning success, as students struggle to recover from inadequacies and vulnerabilities in the adopted technology. We therefore propose a capstone-style course structure to deliver an industry-realistic, project-based, and teamwork-centric software development approach. Using an existing SCRM curriculum, we add acquisition planning, bidding, and monitoring activities to an existing course design and assess learning outcomes. © 2021 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781665431965,,"Proc. - Int.

During semester-long MBCL studies, the students engaged in cooperative learning to discuss a real-life issue or chapter-based contents. With the MBCL platform, the students' group study processes were shown on shared, visible electronic whiteboards that were updated in real-time, generating visible thinking and instant, interactive communication. The instructor was able to guide the students promptly to conduct knowledge integration and knowledge synthesis using tables and diagrams. The deep learning outcome was evident in the examples and quantitative analyses of students' whiteboard study results and team presentations.

We inquired how the lack of teamwork and hands-on activities might influence students' motivation and long-term learning. We compared the data from several outcomes collected in two consecutive academic years to accomplish our goal. The first year was a regular pre-COVID-19 course, and the subsequent one included the burst of COVID-19. The results suggest a correlation between the lack of hands-on activities and a less effective knowledge acquisition. The limitations to create tangible products and the lack of proper teamwork also diminished students' attendance and participation in a virtual environment. We were able to propose some potential solutions to keep going on the hands-on projects under another lockdown.

During 2018 and 2019, a mixed methodology research was conducted in 2 phases. First, a qualitative study that consisted of 15 in depth interviews with current and former female engineering students. In addition, the research team conducted non-participatory observations in 2 courses, to identify elements of group dynamics in mixed gendered classes. This qualitative phase informed the quantitative study designed in the second phase. The quantitative phase took place in two computer programming courses associated to an undergraduate engineering program: Course A, which uses traditional lecture classes, and Course B, which uses project-based learning as the teaching methodology. In course B, a questionnaire (91 responses) was applied to identify the dynamics of role assignment in their teams. A self-efficacy questionnaire on computer programming was applied to courses A (n=33) and B (n =46) to compare the experience of women in the modality of individual and group work. The results indicate that women in course B tend to assume roles of coordination and work management, unlike men who define themselves as programmers or designers. The non-parametric tests applied indicate that when comparing the start and end of the course, the men and women of both courses significantly increased their overall self-efficacy. However, if only items that include execution tasks are considered, women in course B do not significantly improve their self-efficacy, unlike men from course B and both women and men from course A.

To ensure that skills like teamwork are a key focus a series of project-based learning courses were introduced throughout the Bachelor of Engineering programme at Massey University. These project-based courses start in first year and continue each year until the final year where they complete a capstone design project. One difficulty identified was how to effectively assess an individual's contribution to a team-based assessment. This paper reports on the strategies used, evaluation of our approach and a reflection on lessons learnt after 5 years of team-based assessment. An example of the strategies used in a first-year course is given as a case study. Data was gathered from final year students over a three-year period to assess their opinions on teamwork and assessment within project-based learning courses. Students reported both positive and negative aspects of working in teams. Over the 3-year period being studied, the number of negative impacts reduced. This may be due to changes to the courses and/or staff becoming more effective facilitators. Half the students felt peer evaluation fairly distributed grades and half felt it did not. The most frequent comment was that marks were not adjusted enough. Success of individual teams often relies on a combination of careful course design, monitoring by staff, early intervention when needed and creating an environment where students feel they can ask for advice. © 2021 IEEE.","IEEE Computer Society",21659559,9781728184784,,"IEEE Global Eng.

Because the engineering and social challenges of the modern world are rapidly evolving, it is important to adapt teaching methods that reflect these changing times. An increasingly attractive teaching method in the engineering classroom is project-based learning (PBL), which is known to improve engaged-learning outcomes, such as creativity, risk taking, social responsibility, teamwork, self-confidence, and communication. However, it is still unclear how various PBL practices differentially impact these engaged-learning outcomes. Toward the goal of elucidating this, the impact of two different project formats, a virtual presentation versus an in-person presentation, was evaluated for a junior-level chemical engineering core course, Mass and Heat Transfer, over 2 years (248 students total). In surveys conducted after the projects were completed, students were asked to what degree the project improved each of the learning outcomes on a scale of 0 (no impact) to 10 (great impact). Data from these postproject surveys showed no statistically significant differences in impact on teamwork, self-confidence, and communication skills between the two groups. However, the virtual presentation had statistically significant greater positive impacts on student creativity [mean score: 8.9/10 (virtual) vs 7.7/10 (in-person); p < 0.001] and risk taking [mean score: 7.7/10 (virtual) vs 6.1/10 (in-person); p < 0.001], whereas the in-person presentation had a significantly more positive impact on social responsibility [mean score: 6.5/10 (in-person) vs 5.5/10 (virtual); p < 0.05]. Qualitative insights into these results were gathered from discussions with students in focus groups. The results of this study underscore the unique advantages associated with different presentation formats. From the perspective of the current transitions to online learning, the results suggest that changing project deliverables from an in-person to a virtual format may actually yield net gains in engaged-learning outcomes. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","American Chemical Society",00219584,,JCEDA,"J Chem Educ",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101561342

However, the classification of learners into well-structured groups is one of the most challenging tasks in the field. The aim of this study is to propose a novel method to form intra-heterogeneous and inter-homogeneous groups based on relevant student characteristics. Such a method allows for the consideration of multiple student characteristics and can handle both numerical and categorical characteristic types simultaneously. It assumes that the teacher provides an order of importance of the characteristics, then it solves the grouping problem as a lexicographic optimization problem in the given order. We formulate the problem in mixed integer linear programming (MILP) terms and solve it to optimality. A pilot experiment was conducted with 29 college freshmen considering three general characteristics (i.e., 13 specific features) including knowledge level, demographic information, and motivation. Results of such an experiment demonstrate the validity and computational feasibility of the algorithmic approach. Large-scale studies are needed to assess the impact of the proposed grouping method on students' learning experience and academic achievement. © 2021 ACM.","Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450389358,,"ACM Int.

A comparison is also conducted to ascertain the level of cohesion among those teams that were formed using the proposed criteria and those that were not formed using the proposed criteria. The criteria were identified through a combination of qualitative questionnaire survey targeted at the graduated students of the past batches of Computer Science degree program and through synthesizing the literature on engineering capstone project teams identified under the guidance of KSAO framework for software engineering students. To check the effectiveness of the criteria, 100 students were asked to form the teams using the proposed criteria and other 100 students formed the teams without the proposed criteria. Those students that had used the proposed criteria for building teams and those that had formed teams without using the proposed criteria were asked to fill the modified Group Environment Questionnaire to ascertain the level of cohesion among the team members. The results were analyzed qualitatively and through descriptive quantification. The results show that the level of cohesion in teams that were formed using the proposed team building criteria was higher.

Methodological issues are considered, as well as practical recommendations are formulated, for the application of these methods in teaching professionally-oriented disciplines. Examples of project design and their content are given for two specialised disciplines. They are aimed at the development of students' ability to creative thinking and problem-solving when working both independently and in a team. The method effectiveness is illustrated by the formation of students' new competencies, and an increase in their motivation and experience in teamwork. The preferred styles of students' learning were studied for student groups of four different enrolment years. The learning preferences are relatively stable over the four study years. On average, engineering students minoring in textile engineering and design demonstrate a tendency to active, visual, sensing and sequential learning styles. Project-based teaching methods are not universally suitable for students with different learning preferences. Moreover, the success in projecting under the studied conditions correlates with the existing learning preferences of student teams. Student teams succeed in the implementation of projects if they have a balance in the ref-act dimension with a limited preference of the active style. In other words, excessive activity and lack of reflective reflection hindered the successful completion of projects. In the sen-int dimension, the presence of a pronounced sensitive style is also favourable for design and implementation of class projects. Successes in projecting are mostly insensitive to changes in the vis-vrb and seq-glo dimensions. The introduction of the problem and project-based learning methods is useful for engineering students. They acquire new competencies, gain real experience of teamwork, and increase motivation to learn and develop creativity. © 2021 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","IOP Publishing Ltd",17426588,,,"J.

Robots have been widely used in various aspects to help human's interests. In the education sector, robots have also been used as a learning tool to assist in studying fields such as science and technology. Currently, to encourage the development of robots in the education sector, robot competitions are held with various kinds of events. The types of robots developed to participate in robot competitions are also varied, such as mobile robot contest, modular robot contest, humanoid robot contest, flying robot contest, underwater robot contest, innovation robot contest, brick robot contest, and VR robot contest. The robot competition events are held nationally and internationally. The purposes of this study were to identify what kind of skills obtained by students after following the learning process using educational robotics competitions and to determine the appropriate learning model for the use of educational robotics competitions in studying the field of science and technology. This research was a literature review research. The research method was the Comprehensive Literature Review (CLR). This method has three phases such as 1) exploring phase, 2) interpretation phase, and 3) communication phase. The results showed that the learning model that was widely used in educational robotics competitions was project-based learning and was followed by problem-based learning. The skills obtained were to assist understanding science and technology, to develop computer programming skills, to sharpen problem-solving capability, to foster creativity and innovation, to bridge the gap between theory and practice, and to practice teamwork and social skills. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","IOP Publishing Ltd",17426588,,,"J.

Testing the models through empirical research is lacking. This study aims to empirically examine the way teams adapt to unexpected or novel circumstances and investigate the four-phase team adaptation process (i.e. situation assessment → plan formulation → plan execution → team learning), as proposed by Rosen et al. (2011). Design/methodology/approach: To test the positive relationship between the four team adaptation phases and their suggested sequence, a cross-sectional field study was conducted. Data were collected from 23 teams participating during an 8-week team project. Findings: Results from random intercept models confirmed that the team adaptation process consisted of four phases that were positively related to each other. As expected, plan formulation mediated the positive relationship between situation assessment and plan execution. However, team learning was independently related to all three previous phases, and not only to situation assessment as theory suggests. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the present study is one of the first attempts to test the theoretical model of the team adaptation process presented by Rosen et al. (2011). Findings illustrated that the team adaptation process is not a simple four-phase sequence, but it constitutes four dynamic phases that are strongly interrelated to each other. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.",13527592,,,"Team Perform.

This paper describes a culminating first-year experience where student programming teams are paired with clients majoring in a doctor of pharmacy program to develop software applications in support of the clients' community-focused educational outreach activities on the hazards involving the use of electronic cigarettes. In the process, the programming students are exposed to various concepts beyond the expected coverage of technical competencies, focusing on ways to deliver meaningful value to others from an entrepreneurial mindset perspective. Positive feedback and data gathered from student surveys, course evaluations, alumni emails, and client comments indicates that, through this service-learning focused term project, programming students learn valuable software development and personal communication skills that will carry them beyond this course and into their professional lives.

We propose an innovative method to gather information about the personality preferences of our students. The method deviates from the usual as it does not use a personality inventory survey. Instead it relies on self-rating and observations made by peers. We give an account of the activities we implement to instil understanding of the personality concepts associated with the Jungian personality types. We discuss how the students' participation in these activities helped them to apply these concepts to improve their interpersonal skills and teamwork skills. We discuss the implications of our observations. Our method to teaches students about differences between people using the Jungian personality types as a basis to highlight these differences and how they can capitalise on these differences.

Since 2016, healthcare curricula in Taiwan have incorporated IPE-based capstone courses to enhance creativity. To better understand the predictors of team creativity could help educators improve IPE and outcomes for nursing students and patients. Purpose: To determine whether nursing students' demographic characteristics, individual creativity, and perceived team interaction behaviors, team swift trust, team conflict, and team task interdependence may predict high perceived team creativity in IPE settings. Methods: A cross-sectional study design included nursing students (N = 99) at a science and technology university in Taiwan. Data from self-report questionnaires included variables for demographic characteristics, individual creativity, and perceived team characteristics. A hierarchical multiple regression analysis revealed predictors of high perceived team creativity. Results: Nursing students who perceived high team creativity also perceived higher interaction behaviors and lower process conflict than those who perceived less creativity. Spontaneous communication and team task conflict predicted high perceived team creativity. Conclusions: Nursing educators could increase team creativity in IPE by encouraging spontaneous communication and constructive task-oriented conflict management.

The reasons for these difficulties are well known and described in the literature, pointing to difficulties in abstraction and logic thinking. Knowing that the value of flexible and personalized learning, teachers are changing the way they teach, using different active learning methodologies, such as flipped classroom, project-based learning, and peer instruction. This paper describes an experiment conducted to improve the learning experiences of the students enrolled in the Computer Science bachelor's degree course, attending three curricular units: Information Systems Development, Data Structures, and Web Languages and Technologies. The approach followed by the teachers used project-based learning as an active learning methodology. This methodology allows us to achieve four main objectives: (i) improve student engagement; (ii) improve learning outcomes achievement (iii) increase the course success rate and (iv) allow students to experience the need for the software development lifecycle, feeling that software engineering is not a block-based process but depending on previous activity, often leads to the need to go back in the process. The results obtained with the use of the active methodology were well accepted by the students and allowed both teachers and students to reach the objectives set. © 2013 IEEE.","Education Society of IEEE (Spanish Chapter)",19328540,,,"Rev.

Several facets of this process and corresponding challenges exist, including the complex question of how to match students’ skills and competencies with the demands and expectations of the industry. From a different angle, considering the changing nature of work, HEIs are responsible for equipping future employees with skills necessary to work in virtual, distributed, culturally diverse, and frequently global, teams. In the domain of software development, i.e., the backbone of the digital world, the challenge HEIs need to face is paramount. For this reason, the way software development is taught at HEIs is crucial for the industry, for the economy, for the students, and for the HEIs. As there is a tendency in the industry to embrace the scrum method and seek employees equipped with skills necessary for the scrum methodology use, it is necessary to ensure that HEIs offer the students the opportunity to get exposed to scrum. By querying the challenges of switching to agile software development methodologies in senior capstone projects, this paper makes a case that software development and software development methodology form the thrust of a multi-stakeholder ecosystem that defines today’s digital economy and society. In this context, the added value of this paper rests in the elaboration of a method enabling HEIs to move toward scrum in senior projects. © 2021 by the authors.

A number of studies have been reported which introduce social coding tools such as GitHub into PBL4SD. In education, it is important to give feedback (advice, error corrections, and so on) to learners, especially in PBL4SD because almost all learners tackle practical software development from the viewpoint of technical and managerial aspects for the first time. This study regards inspection that is conducted in general software development activities as opportunity of feedback. It is recognized that although inspection is an effective quality improvement method, it is time-consuming activities and conducting it in a synchronous manner is an obstacle. Based on this background, a light weight review method called modern code review is recently proposed. This study extends a way of thinking of the modern code review to review for requirements specification and design documents and proposes a process to run the inspection process on GitHub. We apply this process to an actual PBL4SD.

Social networking tools like wiki have been suggested to allow shared and interactive online learning. This study examined the role of wikis in fostering mutual writing standards among Saudi EFL learners. Students from a KSA university were engaged using the wiki tool in group projects. Data was gathered from (1) the historic supervision of the revision, (2) the pedagogical value for the Wiki, and (3) group interviews with students. Findings also showed that students who made further collaborative modifications to the wiki received better writing performance. Students generally indicated that the pedagogical meaning of the wiki was reasonably positive as a learning tool in EFL writing environment. The findings demonstrate that wikis encourage collaborative writing amongst EFL learners, but teachers must adopt pedagogical techniques that allow students to use wikis effectively for the purpose during the current period of COVID 19 learn-from-home conjunction. © 2021 TESOL International Journal.

Graduate and postgraduate students with excellent subject knowledge, deep understanding of modern working methods, technical and higher-order thinking, engineering intuition and problem-solving skills are in great demand. They should also have professional skills such as well-developed abilities in communication and teamwork, usually in an international work environment. This review discusses the advantages of multidisciplinary study environment, educational strategies such as student-oriented teaching, project-based learning with its applicability to a ""real-world"" setting, active learning techniques, development of entrepreneurial skills, lessons learned and best practices from the international Master Program in Spacecraft Design and the Joint Master Program in Space Science and Technology – SpaceMaster at Luleå University of Technology in northern Sweden. The importance of complementarity between formal, informal and non-formal learning methods for science and engineering students has been specifically highlighted. Connections to the world of work, through active industry involvement in the education in a systematic way, e.g. External Advisory Board, shared services and facilities, joint projects and supervision of Master and PhD students, is recognised as a key success factor for professional training. A structural combination of modern pedagogical tools, strategic partnership with industry, business entities, academic partners and up-to-date multidisciplinary labs creates the conceptual framework for a Competence Ecosystem for fostering a new generation of space scientists and engineers. © 2021 International Astronautical Federation, IAF.

It is now run by the University of Houston using local resources. This student-led project, based on the 5E instructional model, is executed by the students from initial ideation of research objectives to the design, testing, and deployment of scientific payloads. The 5E Instructional model places the student at the center of knowledge building, while instructors facilitate interaction with content and guide the inquiry process. Since 2013, this project has been not only an effective vehicle for delivering STEM education but is also effective in increasing classroom engagement and interest in space. Space research is inherently interdisciplinary and crosscuts Geoscience, Engineering, and Technology. The project is designed to integrate engineering, technology, physics, material science, and earth and atmospheric sciences as an important opportunity for the students to gain access to cross-disciplinary experiential research. In addition to classroom engagement, the students build their own payloads and ground instruments. This project increases students’ command of essential skills such as teamwork, collaboration, problem solving, technology, communication, innovation, and leadership. For the faculty, the project was an extended exercise in professional development, learning how to implement project level inquiry-based education on this scale. For the students, this formative experience continues to encourage the development of a much broader range of technical skills than is typically offered within an undergraduate degree. Furthermore, the extensive time and energy that students commit to this project promotes a strong sense of personal and professional responsibility and emphasizes the necessity of coherent teamwork. Not only do students make valuable connections with each other during this process, but also to the broader space science community. They often work with professionals from outside of the USIP structure, and regularly attend and present at conferences and student competitions throughout the project. This paper will present a web-based scaffolding used to simulate the traditional face to face 5E experience during COVID. Student projects have included subjects ranging from atmospheric trace gas chemistry, LiDAR study of snow and sand avalanche dynamics, auroral electron precipitation, gravity wave modulation of the hydroxyl layer, search for stratospheric microplastics, and monitoring auroral radio emissions, among others. This program is a for-credit course of two to three years duration. Copyright © 2021 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

NaSPUoN, which is funded by this research chair, is a CubeSat model that is currently under development by undergraduate students at the University of Nairobi. It is a demonstrational 1U (10cm x 10cm x 11cm) model. NaSPUoN serves as an important foundation to strengthen capacity for nanosatellite development at the University of Nairobi. NaSPUoN has two missions: The camera and LoRa missions. The objective of the camera mission is earth observation. From the remote sensing images captured, the team will collect information over large spatial areas. The objective of the LoRa mission is to demonstrate store and forward mission, where data from sensors on the ground is sent to the nanosatellite for downlink at the ground station during a pass. The mission also seeks to evaluate the suitability of LoRa communication as a backup for the primary communication system. To facilitate the operation of these two payloads, NaSPUoN has three subsystems: Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS), On-board Computer (OBC) and Communication Subsystems. The EPS will ensure optimal generation and distribution of electrical energy for the entire CubeSat. OBC &amp; Comm. subsystem oversees the control of the other electronics on the CubeSat and communication between the CubeSat and the ground station. The development team for this project is comprised of undergraduate students from three departments at the School of Engineering. These are: Electrical and Information Engineering; Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering; and Geospatial and Space Technology departments. They are guided by faculty members of the same departments. The members from different teams work closely with one another to ensure that a cohesive design is realised. The 11 undergraduate students responsible for the development of the NaSPUoN CubeSat are greatly benefitting from this opportunity. They have been able to apply skills learned in the classroom and develop skills beyond the scope of their courses. The members of the EPS, LoRa, and OBC &amp; Comm. sub-teams have designed their first functional PCBs and broadened their knowledge in embedded systems. The Structure sub-team has been exposed to 3D design and printing and deepened their structural design skills. The Camera sub-team has furthered their remote sensing skills. This collaboration of students from 3 different engineering fields in a single project has helped the students gain a greater appreciation of each other's fields. In this presentation, we will be aiming to present this team project and the lessons learnt in its course. We will also present the challenges faced especially as students from a developing country, working during the pandemic. Copyright © 2021 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

Delivering code written by more than one person means extra work on organizing, communicating, tracking progress, and assessing results. As skills like team management, leadership, teamwork, and communication are not taught as a main course in computer science or engineering universities, a good question to ask is how students learn to be effective? An adequate assumption would be that they see successful companies as models. If a corporation developing software projects uses a certain set of tools, schemes, and concepts to organize their work, then the same things should work for student projects as well. However, even if programs and strategies designed for good teamwork and management have the best intentions in mind, this assumption is not always true. This could result in a poor organization with limited performance. As such consequences are to be avoided, a study focusing on identifying good practices for students could establish the needs of voluntary student organizations in order to meet them without the unnecessary corporate overhead. To correctly assess student voluntary organization status, data describing several team management strategies have been collected both via forms and interviews. The following paper presents a research conducted on student voluntary organizations. This work identifies key tools and management practices that are commonly used by teams of students and how they compare to the tools used inside a company with paid employees. The final purpose is to identify good management practices inside student voluntary organizations that can be used as a reference by students when establishing new teams. The paper starts by analyzing each side’s motivation for working inside a company/organization, continues with setting key performance metrics for collecting data, and ends with a comparative discussion. This study’s contribution represents a series of recommendations of tools and approaches that suit student voluntary organizations the most. © 2021, National Defence University - Carol I Printing House.

Therefore, how to effectively improve girls' CT has become a serious concern. This study integrated two types of project-based learning (PBL) into a Scratch programming course, one with extensive teacher-supported scaffolding and the other with limited teacher-supported scaffolding. To examine their impact on girls' CT skills and self-efficacy, this study applied mixed research methods, conducted a pretest-posttest control group experiment, and analyzed the quantitative and qualitative data collected from 21 grade-3 girls in a primary school. It was found that the extensive teacher-supported scaffolding of PBL in a Scratch programming course is more effective in promoting the CT skills and self-efficacy than limited teacher-supported scaffolding of PBL. These findings have some implications for the effective PBL practice and related teacher professional development. © 2021 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781665427579,,"Proc. - Int.

Computing teaching has many challenges, as it requires different skills from students, often subjective and difficult to assess. In fact, technical knowledge alone is not enough to fully understand what is being taught, but the interpretive and logical skills to deal with practical problems and non-technical skills such as group work, creativity, critical vision, ability to cooperate and communicate. Active learning methodologies as Problem-Based Learning (PBL) have been used to dealing with such challenges, broadly developing technical and non-techniques skills in students. However, despite the benefits of PBL, the student assessment process is one of the points that present its own adversities and, therefore, an aspect that deserves greater attention. To better understand the nuances of this process and how it can contributes to the teaching and learning process based on PBL, this study aimed to investigate primary studies in the last two decades, seeking answers to the following research questions: RQ1) What assessment models are being used?; RQ2) Which aspects are evaluated?; RQ3) What criteria and media have been defined?; RQ4) Who gets involved in the assessment process?; RQ5) What is the ideal frequency to conduct the evaluations?; RQ6) What can these models reveal? As a research method, this study used the Systematic Literature Review method proposed by Kitchenham. As main conclusions, it was possible to identify that: generally, computing education based on PBL occurs at the undergraduate level, having as main educational objective the teaching of technical content; in practice, the need for a diverse teaching team is not reflected, the traditional student-teacher remains; to evaluate students, it is necessary to consider several aspects, technical and non-technical, defining specific criteria for each one of them; the main benefits for students are related to changes in behavior, development of soft skills and better absorption of technical knowledge; as main challenges for students, the difficulty to understand the nuances of the proposed problem and to be the main responsible for devising a solution for it without the figure of a teacher to give a clear definition of how to do it stands out. © 2021 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15394565,9781665438513,PFECD,"Proc.

New engineering graduates struggle not just with the lack of technical skills specific to a company but have issues in generalizing their existing skill set. They also lack procedural knowledge that is contextual to industry (e.g., dealing with stakeholders, communicating solutions). This requires an educational setting that is more conducive to practical problems than a typical course - students already acquire the needed technical skills but instead need to practice applying and integrating them. This can be supported with the creation of a simulated internship (SimInt) environment that aims to enable development and assessment of outcomes that more accurately capture solving real world problems than current technical skill outcomes. Although students who can complete an internship are already able to mature their skills, some students, for many reasons, are unable to pursue such opportunities. This can be addressed with SimInt. We propose a course to mimic the environment of an internship: students would be assigned a large-scale problem that is open-ended and ill-defined and solve the problem in the context of a simulated company. The focus of this experience would be on maturing problem-solving skills rather than practicing specific technical skills. This would involve integrating aspects of process (e.g., applying with a resume, interviewing, etc.), the environment of working with different stakeholders, and the development of solutions. In this work, we contribute a model for a real-world work environment that captures aspects not found in a typical classroom environment. We describe the differences between typical content-based course (e.g., lecture, flipped) and the new model. The model is described in terms of system elements and interactions between them that are conducive to student learning. SimInt is intended to offer an experience similar to a capstone while supporting scalability and being more appropriate as a formative experience. © 2021 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15394565,9781665438513,PFECD,"Proc.

The framework offers well defined stages of the group project which allow students to work on their choice of a real-world problem, integrate their learnings from previous courses, and present a working solution. In the group project, students actively participate, reflect, and contribute to achieving the goals set in the learning objectives of the course. Our framework incorporates key features from Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory (1984) and principles of active learning from Barnes (1989) to achieve active and experiential learning through active supervision. The use of group projects as a teaching pedagogy is widely adopted in many universities. Students work together, develop a plan, and demonstrate their abilities in building on existing knowledge acquired from previous courses, and apply them appropriately for problem solving. Prior to the pandemic, it was the norm for students to work on their group projects together by meeting physically on campus. Key benefits of working together physically are having the support of one another and the ease of communication. With the onset of the pandemic, safe distancing measures, and restrictions put in place have made it challenging for students to work on group projects together. During the pandemic, many courses were forced to move online with limited face-to-face learning opportunities on campus. This posed great challenges to the faculty in terms of effective supervision of students and their project progress. To mitigate the challenges, we devised a flexible strategy that makes use of both technology-based and non-technological means for monitoring students' group project milestones. The faculty receives continuous updates from students as they work towards each milestone. These milestones serve as important checkpoints for students. Continuous checks at different milestones help the faculty adopt appropriate intervention measures as issues arise. The group project learning framework consists of three main stages, namely Group Formation, Scoping of the Project, and Group Solutioning. The framework is overlaid with Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory concepts to describe the learnings, milestones, and deliverables of each stage. Each of these stages adopts Barnes's principles of active learning to enable active participation, reflection, and contribution by students. We evaluated the success of this framework through a comprehensive student survey analysis. The survey asked specific questions to students on all stages of the group project and the overarching component of teamwork and working online. We also present our findings and lessons learned for improvements of the framework. We believe that our framework will be valuable to educators in computing programs that wish to adopt effective supervision measures for group projects. © 2021 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15394565,9781665438513,PFECD,"Proc.

Teaching DS principles, concepts, and practices and relating them to real-world scenarios is challenging, particularly in social isolation circumstances due to Covid-19. Moreover, teaching resources can pose additional setbacks for teachers and students who are unfamiliar with remote learning. Purpose: This study investigates the DS students' perception regarding the methodology and teaching practices adopted by the teacher during the social isolation period. Method: We conducted a survey with the DS subject students to investigate their perception regarding the teaching methodology adopted, the challenges, and their motivation during this period of social isolation. Results: Our findings revealed that most students have adequate study conditions, i.e., a suitable environment for studying at home and the necessary equipment to attend online classes and perform the subject's practical tasks. Moreover, 79% of the students felt motivated to study the subject remotely, and more than 74% of the students endorsed the teaching methodology adopted by the teacher. © 2021 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15394565,9781665438513,PFECD,"Proc.

Students constantly need to reflect on themselves to understand the progress they made and what learning aspects they are currently lacking. As learning is a step-by-step process, therefore to achieve better consistency and learning experience, educational institutions are slowly transitioning summative learning to the combination of both formative and summative learning. Assessment is used to evaluate the progress of learning. However, existing peer assessment tool has limitation. It is unable to fit into all the use cases for different subjects. Moreover, the biasness of the instructor or peers has caused some of the students facing discrimination when doing the peer assessments. Integration of both formative and summative assessment into the peer assessment system could help instructors better understanding their students through feedback provided hence could improve learning strategies. In this paper, the authors proposed a web application, G-PAT, a peer assessment tool that enhances the flexibility of the template of the existing systems to cater different use cases. The SPA and SAPA factors from SPARKLUS are used in the calculation of performance and feedback of the students. The implementation results of G-PAT have shown that more than 90% of the students agree that the tool helps them to evaluate their performance and they are willing to continue to reuse it as their learning companion. © 2021 IEEE.","IEEE Computer Society",23248149,9781665408059,,"Int.

Design problems, typically complex and lacking structure in nature, required an interdisciplinary approach, integrating multiple content domains. The currently most-favored pedagogical models for teaching design are problem-based learning (PBL) and project-based learning (PjBL), both of which are challenged when faced with multidisciplinary open problems, also known as wicked problems. To tackle wicked problems in an educational setting a combination of different pedagogical methods is necessary. This paper strives to create a pedagogical model to use while dealing with wicked problems in the specific education setting of a Master course in an Engineering programme. The behaviorism, cognitivism and situative learning paradigms are analyzed and related to the engineering learning peculiarities, which led to proposing Need-Based Learning (NBL). NBL is a pedagogical approach for teaching product design and development, which innovates by integrating Just-In-Time (JIT) Learning, flipped classroom and gamification in a PjBL setting. NBL includes six activities: challenge, select, acquire, apply, reflect, explain, and evaluate. A challenge is set by the lecturer, which becomes the background for all other course work. During the game phases, the students make a ‘just-in-time’ selection of knowledge to be acquired in the flipped classroom, applying this knowledge in the gamified project and reflecting on their choices and results. The lecturer then gives further feedback and makes the summative evaluation. © 2021 Proceedings - SEFI 49th Annual Conference: Blended Learning in Engineering Education: Challenging, Enlightening - and Lasting?.

These learning experiences increase applied knowledge and retention in students and others in related STEM fields. Using research-based learning theory in a project-based and team-based learning environment, the course developers transformed the learning experience from sterile lecture type courses to interactive experiences that enhance and build on the course concepts. Course surveys were used to collect information from students to further understand how changes to the course delivery impacted them and affected the learning environment. The goal of this research is to further delve into the use of personalized learning to engage and encourage student growth. Initial results suggest improved student engagement, and engagement with course materials as a result of the transformation of class delivery. Evidence shows that the classroom experience is enhanced by this type of activity.

However, team projects commonly impose problems related to responsibility sharing, such as low effort or inequality in contributions. This paper presents a collaborative programming assessment system featuring a code quality assessment function with specific metrics to measure individual contributions. Student engagement data is used to detect nonconformities in collaboration using a learning analytical approach. Latent profile analysis was used to detect four theoretical team profiles differentiated by team effort (2 levels) and within-team collaboration (2 levels). We demonstrated the efficacy of assessing code to evaluate team dynamics and student behaviour, wherein efforts to resolve coding style failures can be used as a proxy by which to estimate the taskwork awareness of team members. Submission data from 146 students in 41 web-programming projects revealed four behavioural patterns that could potentially hinder the effective functioning of programming teams: free-riding, social loafing, the bystander effect, and lone wolves. We also demonstrated the applicability of automated programming assessment systems to the monitoring of learning progress, thereby facilitating timely interventions to correct difficulties at the team level. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Taylor and Francis Ltd.",0144929X,,BEITD,"Behav Inf Technol",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85122036147

In this context, engineering education experienced a new level of complexity, particularly in contexts of project-based learning environments, where students must significantly interact with peers and make group decisions. Added to this context, was the long-triggered need by the industry to train engineers capable of dealing with broad, nontechnical issues. Hence, the ability to telework has become critical for engineering students, particularly to be able to communicate and make teamwork decisions effectively and efficiently in online environments. In this work, we investigated qualitatively how a group of students responded to the rapid transition from formal classroom teaching to remote learning, particularly in the context of responding with conceptual designs to the requirements of project-based courses. The response of sixty-two Engineering Design students from a Chilean technical university is analyzed regarding the usability of the technological tools they used to conceptually solve problems online and how they perceive the teamwork they were able to achieve using these tools. © 2021 Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Institutions.

Students are expected to learn and demonstrate their knowledge of design processes, drawing, and computer-aided-design. In a new interdisciplinary design unit, students were given an ongoing individual design project which assessed their understanding of design, as well as competencies and skills in using their drawing, computer-aided design (CAD) and programming skills - they were also introduced to design through a design challenge that enhanced their individual and collective learning run in partnership with Engineers without Borders. This paper discusses the challenges of not only delivering such an ambitious model to first year engineering students from multiple disciplines-but the online and face-to-face teaching delivery that had to be implemented under Covid-19 restrictions. This paper documents a challenging year for all design educators, with significant uncertainty and rapidly changing circumstances. The conclusions of the paper are that Problem-Based Learning alone may not be suitable for engineering teaching in the first year of study, and with students who are getting to grips with blended learning and self-directed study. A hybrid model of problem and project-based learning may be more adaptable to different learning styles. If Problem-Based Learning is solely to be used it should place more emphasis on team work rather than individual competencies. Further work is to be explored in hybrid or hyflex online and in-class teaching to make the most out of activities linked with Project and Problem-Based Learning. © PDE 2021.","The Design Society",,9781912254149,,"Proc.

Further, we perform bibliometric analyses to gain insights on similar studies published during COVID-19. The study highlights central themes, challenges, and opportunities from a student perspective, and evaluates these within the scope of the PBL model. The study highlights the complex structure of student bodies, showing diverse preferences and effects of moving education online. Social aspects of learning suffered for most, posing challenges for both teaching and group work. Students generally reported positively on the use of recorded lectures, providing opportunities for future blended/flipped learning environments. We discuss the implications for creating hybrid/blended approaches that integrate online and physical learning spaces. © the authors, 2021.

Can the design of a game offer suitable opportunities for relevant science learning about viruses? Moreover, can it contribute to the development of collaboration and communication soft skills, central both for academic success and in real life? This paper reports a case study of a mixed-class group of lower-secondary students in a Swiss Italian-speaking rural school that engaged in the design and development of an educational escape room on viruses during a project week. The paper illustrates how the activities were organized following the Star Model for the design of educational escape rooms, how roles were distributed among pupils and teachers, and what scaffolding was offered in order to blend content and game design, so to achieve a scientifically precise and at the same time fun game. The game design experience has been evaluated through (a) the pre-post assessment of teamwork and leadership self-efficacy; (b) the pre-post assessment of science knowledge about viruses; and (c) an interview with the teacher. The case study illustrated that, while self-efficacy variations are minimal but still positive, designing an educational escape room with pupils can be conducive to relevant subject-matter learning and team building. © The Authors, 2021.

Yet there is little in-depth study at scale and across types of engineering design and innovation classes in higher education that examines the goals students set for their work together. This research explores goal congruence in 857 teams involving 1470 students across 18 classes over four years. To examine goal congruence, we use student assessments of their level of agreement on their goals as well as evaluations of their written goal statements. Machine learning techniques are used to automatically identify goal types and congruence between goals. We find that goal congruence on student teams is relatively low, even when they assess it as high, partly due to variety in the types of goals they identify. We categorize the goals students articulate for their teams into grade-, completion-, teaming-, learning-, problem-, output- and outcome-oriented goals and report variance in the types of goals identified in different pedagogical settings. Our findings have implications for how faculty design their classes, link learning outcomes to team projects and facilitate goal setting on student teams. © 2021 by ASME","American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)",,9780791885406,,"Proc.

With careful evaluation of these data, the effectiveness of the TC approach is assessed. For further refinement, several recommendations are proposed through an annual unit enhancement report to the programme committee of the School of Engineering and Technology, CQU, for implementing improvements in the next offerings. The satisfaction data of the fluid machinery unit obtained by SES until 2016 were low and produced many student queries relating to assessment of student portfolios.

South African universities are experiencing ever-increasing student numbers, diverse student bodies which have different language and literacy skill levels, and limited resources. Simultaneously, the need to decolonise university curricula and teaching and learning practices is being actively investigated across South Africa. In this paper, we discuss preliminary steps we have taken towards achieving this broader transformative agenda in the context of the massification of education, namely designing effective and decolonial assessments that support epistemological access and academic success, while at the same time challenging what counts as ‘powerful knowledge’ (Young and Muller, 2013) in the classroom. We argue that effective decolonial knowledge practices and deep critical engagement can be achieved by using group work portfolio tasks that align with assessment for learning principles (Carless, 2015). Using a design-based research approach, we describe three courses across two universities which have implemented portfolio-type group assessments. The preliminary findings suggest that group projects can yield rich and productive assessment for learning outcomes in large classes. In addition, portfolio projects that purposely interrogate diverse perspectives, knowledges and experiences can harness the diversity of groups to work towards decolonising the classroom. © 2021, University of the Western Cape.

Design/methodology/approach: The participants consisted of 421 students (i.e. form 1 to form 3) from Hong Kong taking a liberal studies course during the 2016–2017 academic year. This study mainly used a mixed methods design, proposing 11 hypotheses. Quantitative data from 374 questionnaires were analysed to test these research hypotheses, while a qualitative method (interviews) was used to explain the quantitative results. A structural equation modelling approach was used to analyse the data, and data triangulation was used to answer the same research questions. Findings: The results showed that the model components PBworks affordances (PB) and rules and divisions (RD) had significant direct effects on individual activities (IA) and community activities (CA) and significant indirect effects on information literacy (IL). The results also revealed that CA had a significant effect on IA and had an even greater effect on IL. Research limitations/implications: Using PBworks and the project-based learning (PjBL) approach, this study examined the determinants affecting the IL skills of Hong Kong junior secondary school students and proposed a wiki-based information literary activity (WILA) model. Practical implications: As students' IL skills have become increasingly important, this study can shed light on related topics for future studies. Social implications: And contribute to social stability and harmonious development. Originality/value: This study eventually confirmed the validity of the WILA model with all hypotheses supported.

Whilst Project Management Offices help in the governance of Information Technology projects, the trending issues and challenges in Agile projects need a great deal of attention. More organisations are embracing the agile method due to its popularity and the benefits it yields. Literature discusses various issues and challenges, with an absence of a holistic review to determine its frequency, impact, and classification systematically. This study attempts to identify the factors addressed in literature over the last 2 decades, producing a list of factors and ranking them according to the most addressed and the frequency of reference. A systematic literature review was undertaken to identify the relevant literature using specific keywords search and filter, arriving at a final list of 175 selected studies for the analysis work, which was used to identify 37 prominent factors affecting agile project success. The highest number of studies and factors discussed were between years 2014 and 2016. Project Governance faired as the most addressed factor, while People related factors were widely discussed. Current trends are focused on attaining project governance with a sound understanding of the agile principles, by people with the right attitude, knowledge, skills, and the ability to work well with the team. Project governance with the careful implementation of the agile method and its processes in stages, with the right support tools and technology, is most important for project success. Competence of project stakeholders possessing the right attitude, with great collaboration and teamwork capabilities, and the ability to garner a close relationship with the customer and clearly articulate changing requirements is key to delivering successful agile projects. Future work will include the understanding and identification of critical challenges and crucial factors for ensuring agile project management success.

The responses to a questionnaire administered to 50 instructors who participated in a specific training program were analyzed. The results show that the instructors’ perception is that both models contribute to a better understanding of the contents with regard to their practical application, and to a high level of skill development in their students, with the most favored being group work, decision-making, autonomous learning and problem solving. The instructors consider important success factors to be student involvement in their own learning from the very beginning, feedback from the professor, the tasks having been well-designed and team work and cooperation among students. The most common difficulties identified in our study correspond to the excessive workload associated with monitoring the students, and managing and developing within the established time the planning of their tasks and activities, although there is a medium level of incidence in this regard, and it may be due to the characteristics of the training program received.

There is a gap in different processes in IT industries and engineering institutes due to a mismatch in industry expectations and academic practices. According to different survey reports, this gap is increasing significantly due to lack of domain knowledge, inabilities of adopting recent technologies, old curriculum contents, poor assessment methodologies, and old project development practices, etc. To make students industry-ready, it is necessary to inculcate recent software development processes in academics. Academic project is one of the important courses in an undergraduate program which inculcates industry required skills among the students to bridge the gap to a greater extent. In this work, the gap in academic software project development practices is identifies through feedback from industry experts, alumni, and previous three years' student projects. This paper presents Industry Oriented Software Engineering Practices (IOSEP) methodology to adopt the recent industry practices in academics for improving students' project quality. The proposed methodology is implemented for the third-year mini project and a final year capstone project for academic year 2018-19. The IOSEP methodology incorporates an agile model, industry coding practices, GitHub platform, modern tools and technologies, testing tools, real-time deployment and, LaTex for documentation. To analyse the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, a new skill-based assessment method and rubrics are designed. K-means clustering is used to analyse students' performance. The Elbow method and silhouette analysis are used to select the number of clusters. Results show that optimal cluster values are three and more than 38% of students are in excellent cluster. The post feedback analysis from faculties and students show that project quality improved compared to previous years on development time, coding practices, technology use, and technical report writing. Industry-sponsored projects, participation in project competitions, student paper publications, and placement statistics are improved than the previous three years. © 2021, Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology.

Fifteen courses—including laboratory, discussion-based, large lecture, tutorial, and problem-based learning—within a multi-disciplinary faculty at a large research-intensive Canadian university were surveyed to: (a) assess student and instructor perceptions of students’ levels of engagement during and after the rapid transition to online teaching due to the COVID-19 pandemic; (b) describe which aspects of engagement were enhanced or diminished due to the rapid online transition; and (c) identify which learning activities students would find most engaging in an online setting so as to assist in developing student-centered online pedagogical techniques. Student engagement was lower after the rapid online transition. Students who engaged by connecting with peers and instructors through in-class discussion (affective engagement) had diminished engagement, whereas students who engaged by listening to lectures, reading course materials, and reviewing slides (cognitive engagement) had enhanced engagement. Overall, students found synchronous activities more engaging.

To achieve this, connections established among the disciplines corresponding to S, T, E, A and M are analysed. The second contribution presented in this paper is the study of the relationships established between the members of the educational community and the external educational agents (artists, researchers and research centres) involved in the project. These relationships among all the educational agents give rise to important connections relevant to STEAM education. Additionally, an increase in performance and interest in science and technology manifested by the students is analysed in a quantitative way.

The development of teamwork competence in education generally relies in project-based learning methodologies and challenges. The assessment of teamwork in project-based learning involves, among others, assessing students’ participation and the interactions between team members. Project-based learning can easily be handled in small-size courses, but course management and teamwork assessment become a burdensome task for instructors as the size of the class increases. Additionally, when project-based learning happens in a virtual space, such as online learning, interactions occur in a less natural way. This study explores the use of instant messaging apps (more precisely, the use of Telegram) as team communication space in project-based learning, using a learning analytics tool to extract and analyze student interactions. Further, the study compares student interactions (e.g., number of messages exchanged) and individual teamwork competence acquisition between traditional asynchronous (e.g., LMS message boards) and synchronous instant messaging communication environments. The results show a preference of students for IM tools and increased participation in the course. However, the analysis does not find significant improvement in the acquisition of individual teamwork competence. © 2021, Universidad Internacional de la Rioja.

Projectbased learning is a student-centric approach in which students learn about a course by working in groups to solve an open-ended real world problem. In our opinion, it takes students near to the real world at a very early stage. For students, it acts as a tool to learn concepts and principles, to adapt to the evolving ICT industrial requirements and challenges. The objective here is to convey our systematic teaching and learning method, based on Project- based learning, to effectively learn the principles and practices of Software Engineering. Also, it prepares students how to apply these theoretical concepts to solve the real world problems by working in a team. For more than 10 years we are conducting this activity very rigorously for Third Year Computer Engineering students. This activity incorporates applying theory of Software Engineering to develop experiential learning by developing a mini-project using Database and Web Technology. Our 7- point method for development of mini-project has continuous Assessment through critical reviews and presentations by students. We conducted survey for all batches and took their feedback to understand the role of Project Based Learning in their Professional Career. Feedback of these students helps us to update our methodology and/or course contents. Applying Database technology and getting acquainted with development of user interface is bit easy for students but applying the Software Development Life Cycle [3] learnt in Software Engineering is quite challenging. There are many skills they learn and acquire while developing mini-project like questions to be asked during field work, design strategy and analysis through modelling, teamwork[4], time management, communication skills and many more which takes them a step closer and works as a basic building block for their growth as a software professional. Our survey questionnaire gives insight of all and acts as a measuring tool. This paper addresses our 7-point method, design, our process of evaluation and challenges faced by the students and faculty during this process with the help of representative projects. © 2021, Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology.

Nowadays, the widespread use of mobile learning applications has brought significant changes in education. This paper addresses the problem of using mobile learning applications for developing universal competencies among students. The purpose of the research is to assess the effectiveness of using mobile applications for the development of universal competencies in students. Materials and Methods. The data were collected through reviewing and critical analysis of research literature on the development of competencies among students of higher educational institutions and the use of information, computer and mobile technologies for educational purposes. The empirical study was conducted using methods of educational research from 2017 to 2019. The sample consisted of students in years 3-5 doing an undergraduate degree in Education. Methods of mathematical statistics were employed for processing empirical data (correlation analysis). Results. The paper presents the results of evaluating the effectiveness of using mobile applications for developing students' universal competencies. The authors identified the indicators for assessing the development of the selected universal competencies. The authors examined the following stages of developing universal competences by means of using mobile learning applications: (1) knowledge and skills alignment in the field of using mobile learning applications; (2) demonstrating knowledge and skills of using mobile learning applications; (3) inclusion of mobile learning applications in studying various disciplines (modules); (4) using mobile learning applications as a part of a larger activity (group projects); (5) using mobile learning applications for academic assessment (self-evaluation). It is emphasized that it is necessary to purposefully include students' work with mobile applications in the educational process of the university, when a student, being an active participant in the educational process, uses mobile applications to master the content of the discipline, enhance competencies and evaluate them. Conclusions. The article concludes that characteristics of using mobile learning applications identified and described in this research facilitate the development of students' universal competencies. The findings can be used to improve the efficiency of the educational process at the university. © 2011-2020 Science for Education.","Novosibirsk State Pedagogical University",26586762,,,"Sci. Edu.

Yet, as a precondition for setting up an educational programme within an academic institution, one needs to be able to delineate the discipline being taught (Sinclair and Gouglas 2002, 168) in terms of a coherent academic identity, interrelations between courses, and skills that graduates will attain. Therefore any locally situated educational enterprise needs to focus on those areas of DH that can be reasonably tied to research conducted at the hosting institution. At the University of Helsinki, we have put particular effort into defining our educational profile in interdisciplinary computational humanities, taught both as a minor studies module (30 ECTS) and an MA track (120 ECTS). Because of the complexities of humanities data and the lack of standard protocols for dealing with it, it is very difficult for a humanities scholar to apply computational and statistical methods in a trustworthy manner without specialist help. At the same time, neither can computer scientists, statisticians or physicists answer humanities questions on their own, even if they understand the algorithms. Our solution to this problem is to argue that computational humanities research, and as a consequence also digital humanities education, should be fundamentally interdisciplinary endeavours, where statisticians, computer scientists and scholars in the humanities work together to develop, test and apply the methodology to solve humanities questions. Our version of computational humanities thus exists precisely and solely at the intersection of humanities and computer science rather than as separate from either of them. Consequently, people participating in this field should primarily anchor their academic profile to one of the parent disciplines instead of trying to find an identity purely in the middle. This is reflected in our educational approach. We provide students in the humanities with instruction on how to use ready-made tools, workflows or applied programming, granting them a general digital competency and agency, but our focus is on developing a broader literacy regarding data and computational methods. By learning to contextualize their skills within the field of computational humanities as a whole, the humanities students also learn to assess where their personal boundaries lie, and where an interdisciplinary collaboration is required instead. In this context, their computational literacy also helps them converse with the methodological experts coming to the field from computer science. In this interdisciplinary setting, we take a project-based approach to learning, tying teaching to actual research projects being conducted at the faculty. This approach both harnesses the varying competencies of our students and provides an excellent basis for learning interdisciplinary collaboration (Bell 2010). The culmination of our project courses is the Digital Humanities Hackathon, a multidisciplinary collaboration between the University of Helsinki digital humanities programme and the data science programmes at the Department of Computer Science and Aalto University. For researchers and students from computer and data sciences, the Hackathon is an opportunity to test their abstract knowledge against complex real-life problems; for people from the humanities and social sciences, it shows what is possible to achieve with such collaboration. For both, the Hackathon gives the experience of working with people from different backgrounds as part of an interdisciplinary team and simulates group work in such professional settings as the students may find themselves in after graduation, acculturating them to work outside academia (cf. Rockwell and Sinclair 2012). Our conception of computational humanities as intrinsically collaborative and interdisciplinary is based on the realisation that the traditional, single-author research culture of the humanities is a hindrance to successfully integrating computational approaches into humanities research. We feel that our formulation of the field has the power to contribute to the renewal of research culture and education within the humanities in general, adding value to traditional disciplinary curricula, as well as equipping students with skills relevant in the workplace. © 2020, University of Tartu Press.

Communication and collaboration skills are required as essential skills of qualified developers in the modern environment, in addition to the technical hard skills of software engineering. Therefore, group projects are included in almost courses to train students' professional skills and teamwork abilities. However, in their group projects, most of the students are only required to accomplish functional requirements with limited awareness about the quality of the software. This issue seriously affects the development speed, since it is difficult for team members to read others' code during the development process. Hence, we propose a quality-driven assessment system for group projects with the capability of checking the coding style after each submission and providing immediate feedback to help student teams maintain the code quality for their group projects. Besides, to objectively assess the contribution of all students in group projects, we propose a set of repository mining metrics including two major categories of productivity and quality. A case study about the usage of the system and the proposed contribution evaluation metrics are introduced to illustrate the feasibility of our approach. © 2020 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728192550,,"Proc. - Int.

The research is a Quasi-Experiment with a Nonequivalent Pretest-Posttest Control Group Design. The participants involved are 53 students of class X from a high school in Malang, where 28 students studied with STEM-PjBL, and 25 students studied with discovery learning. This research was conducted on the impulse and momentum topic. In this analysis, the researchers have developed a set of problem-solving instrument with a particular field approach to impulse and momentum topics to obtain an instrument with a reliability of 0.81. This instrument collects student problem-solving data before and after learning both in the experimental class and in the comparison class. Problem-solving skills data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. The results showed a significant difference in the scores of students’ problem-solving skills in the experimental class and the comparison class (p<0.05). The problem-solving skill in the experimental class (Mdn=78.74) was higher than the comparison class (Mdn=70.00). In STEM-PjBL learning, students are better trained and challenged to solve problems in everyday life. Compared to the comparison class, learning in the experimental class is more able to accommodate students’ ideas and make students more interested in learning. In conclusion, STEM-PjBL has a significant positive effect on improving students’ problem-solving skills rather than discovery learning. © 2020 Science Education Study Program FMIPA UNNES Semaran.","Universitas Negeri Semarang",23391286,,,"J.

The research participants included 297 FIRST graduates, mostly high schoolers, who responded to questionnaires, and five of them were interviewed. Analysis of the data showed that the FIRST program improved graduates’ interpersonal skills such as time management, teamwork skills, and self-efficacy, as well as had an impact on the graduates’ STEM career choices. The main factors impacting the graduates’ career choice was their exposure to robotics and to experts from the industry. The theoretical contribution is to the social cognitive theory (SCT) in the context of the FIRST program.

The study was conducted during an intervention in an introductory-level biology course (N = 420) in which one section of the course was taught with active-learning approaches and the other with traditional didactic teaching. GSR results were aligned and correlated with the Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM, or COPUS, and student self-reflections on their own engagement. Results showed that the active-learning section spent more time working in groups, resulting in GSR measures that trended higher and self-reported engagement, while showing indications of higher content learning gains compared with the traditional lecture section. Comparisons between COPUS scores and GSR readings indicate that engagement increased during group work and decreased during listening activities. Throughout a class period, GSR activity of the active-learning group showed increased trends compared with baseline measures, while the traditional lecture group showed decreased trends. Results indicate that GSR is a promising measure of real-time student engagement in the undergraduate classroom, bringing a new tech-nique to discipline-based education researchers who aim to better measure student en-gagement; however, some limitations exist for broad-scale implementation. © 2020 K.

The survey proposes a number of blue print approaches which can be used to introduce teaching CPS design while respecting local constraints on human and financial resources. Due to emphasis on soft skills and the ability to actually design systems, there is a common agreement on the need to include projects in the curriculum. In some countries, such as US and Singapore, this could come in the form of a so-called capstone project. CPS design requires access to physical objects and team work. Some courses might be attended online, but physical presence cannot be completely avoided. In relation to this, learning to design CPS products while working full-time on a job is not a good idea. CPS design requires learning complex formal techniques, which need the full attention of the learner over a longer and uninterrupted period.","IEEE Computer Society",21682356,,,"IEEE Des.

The study was carried out according to a factorial experimental design (2 × 2) and mixed methods approach was used. The study was conducted on 41 teacher candidates randomly assigned to vertical and shared e-leadership groups. As a data collection tool; Self-Regulated Learning Scale, Motivation Scale, Transactive Memory Scale, Group Atmosphere Scale, Group Cohesion Scale, and a semi-structured interview form were used. Research findings indicate that there is no statistically significant difference between vertical and shared e-leadership groups in terms of self-regulated learning skills, motivation and group collaboration processes.

Online collaboration allows more convenient ways for people to connect to each other anywhere and anytime. With the rapid development of technologies, online collaboration has become common and widely used for various purposes. The aims of this paper are two-fold, (1) To discuss how online collaborative workflow facilitates the overall creation processes of two digital learning videos on mental health knowledge and management and, (2) To identify key facilitative and impeding factors for a successful online collaborative workflow for creating digital learning videos on mental health. This paper presented the workflow and the findings of facilitating and impeding factors of online collaboration. Based on a qualitative data analysis of comments from collaborative members, four facilitative factors were identified as (a) individual commitment, (b) affective team support, (c) consensus and empowerment, and (d) clear instructions. There were also five impeding factors perceived by the collaborative members which are (a) lack of time, (b) challenges inherent to virtual communication, (c) technology and resource constraint, (d) lack of clear and tight guidelines, (e) lack of structured steps. Based on these findings, recommendations are provided for a more efficient online collaborative workflow to initiate group projects in online environments which is increasing in demand in the new normal era.

Graduate attributes are the skills and behaviors embraced in the application of knowledge. Universities exercise discretion in the manner in which GAs are assessed be it as individual activities or as a dynamic interplay between a progression of activities. At a University of Technology in the Western Cape, an integrated computer project (ICP) was selected as an effective opportunity where eight GAs was assessed. This is the first time GAs will be measured in the final year of an undergraduate program. Within the ICP a range of principles was identified and pedagogies were employed to deliver the assigned GAs. In meeting a diverse range of learning outcomes for the ICP, the knowledge areas applied range from design and synthesis to computing and information technology. Transferable skills employed include teamwork, leadership, personal motivation, time management, research skills, analytical skills, listening skills, and written communication skills. The ICP harnesses the sub-competencies of the eight GAs as the evaluation criterion for associated activities. This paper offers a recollection of the development of the ICP from which the key principles framing the subject and the pedagogies employed to align the objectives and outcomes are identified and discussed. The principles and pedagogies form a framework that joins the five knowledge disciplines into a connected curriculum at a key point during the students' education to provide preparation for, and a small-scale experience of, professional engineering.

In this study, we implemented project-based techniques in biomedical engineering (BME) classes, and we investigated the effects of active learning on students' self-efficacy as an effective predictor of students' academic persistence and their career decision-making. Differences in self-efficacy were compared across genders. A high level of internal consistency was observed for both academic and career-oriented scales, as determined by Cronbach's alpha values of 0.908 and 0.862, respectively. While average scores of all survey questions indicated improvement in students' academic and career-oriented self-efficacy measures, significant improvements were observed in ""clearer vision of programming application in engineering"" and ""BME careers,"" as well as in ""expectation of success in a future BME career that involves developing medical devices"" after the completion of the project-based activity (p = 0.002, 0.023, and 0.034, respectively). For two of the survey questions, female students reflected a significantly lower ""self-confidence about understanding the most complex course material"" as well as a significantly lower ""willingness to have a future career in BME that involves intensive computer programing"" as compared to male students (p = 0.035 and 0.024, respectively).

For a practicing Engineer in the workplace today, expected skills go beyond the technical skills and working in a team. A mandatory requirement is the ability to interface with a customer: how to understand the client needs and how to deliver a suitable result. This paper describes the results of an experiment on Project based activities in a course unit of an Engineering degree, that aims at creating an environment that promotes the acquisition of entrepreneurial skills. In this course unit, groups of 4 to 6 students develop a project to solve a problem proposed by a company. Each team acts as an engineering company, providing a service to their customer. During project development, a member of the University staff and a representative of the company, which acts as a customer, supervise each team. To create an environment similar to a business environment, student teams participate in a bid for the projects they want to develop, competing with other groups. All groups start by preparing project proposals that the companies assess, similarly to what they would do with proposals from subcontracted companies. At the end of this process, the proposing companies rank the proposals received and a match is made between companies and students' preferences. The choice for this approach results from the perception that it fosters students' autonomy and responsibility and, thus, better prepares students for the transition into professional life. The success of the project will depend on the level of commitment in preparing their proposal, which requires, among other things, clearly understanding the client needs, developing an adequate solution and being able to communicate their ideas in the proposal. A survey, conducted at the end of the academic year, assessed the results obtained with this process. The responses show generalized approval of this model by both parties involved (students and supervisors) showing that, at least from their perspective, the proposed assignment process attended the expected results. © 2020 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15394565,9781728189611,PFECD,"Proc.

This study observes 150 college students who first individually solve exercises and then carry out a class project in teams of three. All projects had the same requirements. We analyzed how students' behavior on individual pre-project exercises predict team project outcomes, investigated how students' time management practices affected other team members, and analyzed how students divided their work among peers. Our results indicate that teams consisting of only low-performing students were the most dysfunctional in terms of workload balance, whereas teams with both low-and high-performing students performed almost as well as teams consisting of only high-performing students. This suggests that teams should combine students of varying skill levels rather than allowing teams with only low performers or letting students to form teams without constraints. We also observed that individual students' poor time management practices impair their teammates' time management. This underlines the importance of encouraging good time management practices. Most teams reported that they divided tasks in a way that is beneficial for the acquisition of technical skills rather than collaboration and communication skills. Only a few teams assigned tasks so that students would have worked only on tasks they already knew and thus felt most comfortable to work with. © 2020 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15394565,9781728189611,PFECD,"Proc.

Extant literature has analyzed the benefits and demerits of these instructional methods. Moreover, there are considerable amount of literature that have proposed a set of professional competences required by employers in engineering and computing professions. Currently, there is paucity studies that have investigated the instructional methods that best support the delivery and acquisition of core professional competences by instructors and students respectively. This creates a gap in literature and leave some research questions unanswered. For instance, which instructional methods best support instructors to deliver professional competences such as problem solving, teamwork and critical thinking? On the other hand, which instructional methods best enable students to acquire professional competences? The aim of this on-going research is to report the progress we have made in our attempt to close this gap, answer this research question, and thus contribute to knowledge. Accordingly, we present a set of instructional methods and professional competences in computing and engineering as identified from extensive literature.

The products include non-technical skills covered in research in the area and the relationship of the technical knowledge explored in each paper with the pillars of Industry 4.0. Also included are the most frequently methodologies related to this theme and teaching methodologies that complement engineering skills development with the Project-Based Teaching (PBL) approach. A formal protocol was used, applied using manuals and search filters. Exclusion criteria were involved, rejecting all papers associated with at least one exclusion criterion defined in the protocol. After applying the search string, 2513 papers were collected, of which only 18 were allowed without restrictions due to the exclusion requirements. This research allowed us to answer the following research questions: Which active learning methodologies are often used in conjunction with Project-Based Approaches (PBL) to improve the engineering profile in Industry 4.0? What skills are these students developing? How are performance assessments carried out during and after applying these methodologies? What is the relationship between classroom strategies and real-world problem-solving? The main results indicate that most of the mapped works are almost as naturally as the skills associated with computer simulation. However, few studies have explored more than two pillars of Industry 4.0 during classroom activities. Among the non-technical skills, such as those most often cited in teamwork, were communication (written and oral), learning autonomy, and time management. It was also possible to identify three main groups of approaches focused on solving real-world problems. The first group focused on solving real-world problems to improve technical skills (required by the industry or university). The second one focused on solving problems that are part of everyday life and social student interaction. A third group that develops projects to evaluate technical and non-technical skills focused on technology, a tool, or to consider a model. © 2020 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728192680,,"Proc.

Thus, the objective of this research was to reveal the underlying reasons of making success in IT projects from the undergraduate students perspective. To attain this objective, an empirical study was carried out in an engineering institution in Bangladesh. The study was replicated with the 95 undergraduate students major in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) program. The study data was collected using the questionnaire approach and analysis using the content analysis and the affinity diagram. The study revealed a total of ten success factors for the successful completion of IT-related students' projects. The outcomes will help all parties (teachers, students and administration) of an academic institution to improve the awareness and to diagnose problems at the beginning of pursuing any IT related projects, which in turn will contribute to improve the overall success of IT-related students' projects.

Moreover, designing visualization courses by matching the different experiences and skills of the students is a major goal in order to find a common solvable task for all of them. Particularly, the given task is important to follow a common project goal, to collaborate in small project groups, but also to further experience, learn, or extend programming skills. In this article, we survey our experiences from teaching 116 student project groups of 6 bachelor courses on information visualization with varying topics. Moreover, two teaching strategies were tried: 2 courses were held without lectures and assignments but with weekly scrum sessions (further denoted by TS1) and 4 courses were guided by weekly lectures and assignments (further denoted by TS2). A total number of 687 students took part in all of these 6 courses. Managing the ever growing number of students in computer and data science is a big challenge in these days, i.e., the students typically apply a design-based active learning scenario while being supported by weekly lectures, assignments, or scrum sessions. As a major outcome, we identified a regular supervision either by lectures and assignments or by regular scrum sessions as important due to the fact that the students were relatively unexperienced bachelor students with a wide range of programming skills, but nearly no visualization background. In this article, we explain different subsequent stages to successfully handle the upcoming problems and describe how much supervision was involved in the development of the visualization project. The project task description is given in a way that it has a minimal number of requirements but can be extended in many directions while most of the decisions are up to the students like programming languages, visualization approaches, or interaction techniques. Finally, we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of both teaching strategies. Graphic abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]. © 2020, The Author(s).","Springer",13438875,,,"J.

We wanted them to focus on the creation of a game that people would love to play without worrying about some score objectives to maximize and without caring about their instructors' game design preferences. Accordingly, we decided to ask students to do all the job, starting from the submission and the selection of the game concepts to develop during the course, up to the final evaluation of the projects, the evaluation of their teammates, and thus basically the grading.

Popular agile software engineering processes like Scrum were designed for use in environments that have significant differences from those in the classroom. These differences include the relative importance of student learning and growth with respect to that of producing a product, and the varying levels of experience, availability, and motivation of developers in the classroom. In curriculums that only have a single software engineering course or capstone course, this course may also be tasked with teaching students about various software engineering concepts and activities. A software maintenance-focused process designed for use in these types of environments can accommodate the large set of learning outcomes these courses are meant to provide. However, understanding and adhering to a process while learning how to work and communicate with other developers on a relatively large and unfamiliar software project is a daunting set of tasks for many novice developers. The importance of tool support for agile processes has been recognized, but little such support has been designed for these types of environments. This paper aims to articulate two primary contributions: 1) a software maintenance-focused process suitable for use in a software engineering classroom, and 2) a toolset to support this process and the environment in which it operates. © 2020 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728156194,,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

Individuals, however, do not function in isolation, and successful projects most often rely on team work. Team performance does not depend only on the skills of the individual team members, but also on other collective factors, such as team spirit and cohesion. It is not an uncommon situation (for instance, experienced by the authors while working on this paper) that a hard-working individual has the capacity to give a good example to her team-mates and motivate them to work harder. In this paper we adopt the model of Kleinberg and Oren (EC'14) on time-inconsistent planning, and extend it to account for the influence of procrastination within the members of a team. Our first contribution is to model collaborative work so that the relative progress of the team members, with respect to their respective subtasks, motivates (or discourages) them to work harder. We compare the total cost of completing a team project when the team members communicate with each other about their progress, with the corresponding cost when they work in isolation. Our main result is a tight bound on the ratio of these two costs, under mild assumptions. We also show that communication can either increase or decrease the total cost. We also consider the problem of assigning subtasks to team members, with the objective of minimizing the negative effects of collaborative procrastination. We show that whereas a simple problem of forming teams of two members can be solved in polynomial time, the problem of assigning n tasks to n agents is NP-hard. © Aris Anagnostopoulos, Aristides Gionis, and Nikos Parotsidis.","Schloss Dagstuhl- Leibniz-Zentrum fur Informatik GmbH, Dagstuhl Publishing",18688969,9783959771450,,"Leibniz Int.

However, limited studies have been conducted to explore the nature of interactions between a Scrum Master and other team members and the effect of these interactions on team effectiveness. The aim of this study is to understand the interactions between the Scrum Master and other team members in an educational setting and propose and demonstrate an application of cooperative game theory for the same. Cooperative game theory can model scenarios where other team members can benefit from cooperating. Through the lens of the cooperative game-theoretic model, we investigated the strategies employed by the Scrum Master and other team members when involved in a semi-capstone IT project. Specifically, the study explored the team interaction between a Scrum Master and other team members at three different levels of team effectiveness: least effective, partially effective, and most effective. Our results indicate that a Scrum Master should be active to maximize their payoff as well as the teams' overall payoff. Contrary to this, other team members should be active in the most and partially effective teams, while being passive in the least effective teams at higher costs of interpersonal relations and the processes. The results of the study represent a novel application of game-theoretic modeling for understanding the Scrum Master and other team member interactions. These results are applicable not just in an educational setting but also to the wider area of software development by identifying the right set of strategies by the Scrum Master, and other team members in order to help IT professionals to maximize their payoff. © 2020 by the authors.","MDPI AG",22277390,,,"Mathematics",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091371851

This traditional perspective considers that the formal mathematical knowledge has to be taught prior to the application so, once taught, it can be used to solve problems. Along with this criticism, curricular alternative proposals that have focused attention on the learning process (rather than in the teaching one) have been developed. Recently, game-based learning has been developed as a problem-based learning methodology, able to achieve a deeper implication of the students. In line with this approach, the main scope of this paper is to provide evidence of the learning process in game-based learning environments. To do this, student teachers have designed an educational escape room that fits curricular learning outcomes. This manuscript reports on an educational escape room experience that was implemented in three different Primary Education Schools (total student population of 117 students, while here we present a fragment of 5 participants). In order to evaluate the development of certain knowledge, a transcribed fragment is presented and analyzed. In the reported experience, evidence of learning processes and horizontal mathematization are reported in the frame of an educational escape room. This constitutes an evidence of learning processes in gamified environments. © 2020 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","MDPI AG",22277102,,,"Educ.

Soft and transferable skills acquisition is currently perceived as a core component of doctoral studies. Examples include writing and communication, teamwork, time management, leadership, resource management, negotiation, problem solving, listening, planning, entrepreneurial spirit, mastering ethics awareness, etc. The need for such skills is due to the leading role that doctoral students are expected to play in society. As such, various organizations have issued recommendations for doctoral programs to include a formal component of soft skills training. In this article, an effective way of introducing soft and transferable skills acquisition in doctoral engineering education is introduced. Namely, a form of collaborative project-based learning is designed as a compulsory course. This includes a set of base lectures, a long period of parallel working groups focusing on the various aspects of organizing an international conference, running the actual conference, and performing a post-conference assessment.

The traditional methodology (lectures and seminars) was substituted by a project-based learning strategy, in which students work in groups proposing and developing technical solutions to an actual environmental problem, with the aim of identifying the optimum one, combining technical and economic points of view. This new teaching methodology has been identified as a good approach to increase the students' engagement, with significant improvements in grades (from average values close to 5/10 to >7/10) and better impressions expressed by the students, which can identify the relevance of environmental problems in the development of their own professional curriculum. The core of this methodology is the use of GPS-X software to study and analyse the different approaches proposed by the students as solutions for their project, to optimise the designs, to study the sensitivity to different process conditions and to evaluate the energy and maintenance costs of each proposal. GPS-X software is an inductive and comprehensive tool to reinforce previous theoretical concepts and allows a fast analysis of the responses of industrial plants after each disruption, increasing the dynamism of the learning process. The final assessment, based on the continuous evaluation and a final written report, allows the evaluation of transversal skills, such as teamwork, self-management, communication and problem-solving, difficult to assess by a traditional methodology. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC","John Wiley and Sons Inc.",10613773,,CAPEE,"Comput Appl Eng Educ",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087808144

An online survey (self-report study) was administered to undergraduate students in three sections of an introductory IT concepts class at a northeastern U.S. university. The results indicated that social presence is the most significant factor because it is not only related to both perceived usefulness and team cognitive elaboration but also directly related to perceived learning. Social presence is a construct from the Transactional distance theory and Computer-Mediated Communication that have been previously applied in both theoretical tracks as environmental factors for effective online learning. In theory, by adding relevant learner characteristics constructs, an environmental factor, and team knowledge management constructs in an integrated model of learning in the wiki for collaborative teamwork context, we bridge a major gap in wiki-related research for education.

In this paper, we investigate the effect of presenting teams of students with GitLab metrics about their performance at coursework consultation sessions (checkpoint sessions), with a particular focus on the number of issues assigned and completed, and the number of commits made to the repository. A comparative analysis of project marks in two consecutive academic years indicates that these checkpoint sessions may lead to better student outcomes. An interview study with students and teaching assistants identified viewing the GitLab metrics in the checkpoints as an opportunity to see the relative contributions of team members and address resulting issues, and as a catalyst for improving engagement with the team project.

This software focuses on providing an interactive solution to a given dataset scenario supporting the detection of insights based on users' tasks at hand. However, while creating such a tool several software development stages have to be taken into account, with requirements engineering as one of the major repeating stages. In this paper we describe three different visualization project-based teaching strategies TSH, TSM, and TSL depending on the degree of freedom for the student groups. Moreover, they differ in the way how requirements engineering is an inherent ingredient in order to design, implement, test, deploy, evaluate, maintain, and evolve a certain software product. We experienced with more than 1,000 students in a total of 9 courses running over 8 weeks each, in approximately 2 years of time. All of the three teaching strategies have their own benefits and drawbacks, however, requirements engineering is considered more or less important, mostly depending on the degree of freedom the student project groups got during the courses. As a major outcome we consider the courses successful, not only because we learned the importance of requirements engineering for teaching project-based visualization courses, but also because many students passed the courses, the student evaluation was quite positive, and the written reports showed that they had an immense learning effect. © 2020 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728183442,,"Proc. - Int.

Students took short speaking tests before and after the class, and the fluency, complexity and accuracy of the pre- and posttests were measured to see which, if any, of these three aspects of proficiency would show improvement. The results indicated that participants made marginal progress in fluency, reducing their number of pauses and increasing their raw speech rate slightly, and significantly improved their syntactic complexity (p<.001, d=1.1) and both syntactic (p=.04, d=.48) and pronunciation accuracy (p=.002, d=.75), but did not seem to make gains in lexical complexity. Overall, the results suggest that project-based learning can result in clear improvements in oral proficiency, meaning that it can be appropriately implemented in oral communication classes, but that the greatest gains are likely to be made in accuracy and syntactic complexity. However, it is still unclear whether different types of project settings will affect L2 oral proficiency in the same way. © 2020 Editorial Board TESL - EJ.

To cope-up with the technological standards and create superior work, it is essential for students to do significantly more than memorising the shared information. They need to use superior intellectual skills and learn to work in team. To ensure our students are engaging in quality Project Based Learning, department of Computer Science and Engineering, Malnad College of Engineering has attempted a framework to learn a programming course in a deeper way by exploring local problems and challenges. Python programming typically being a programming language needed an alternative teaching methodology to impart students the necessary technical skills and problem-solving capability. Hence, a systematic approach motivating the students to understand the syntax and apply the same to provide simple solutions to local problems was adopted. The approach started by assigning certain topics of the course to the students. These topics were presented to their peers at the end of second month of the semester. This improved active learning by the students. The syntax and contents facilitated by the students helped them to come out with excellent solutions to local problems inthe form of projects. The process focussed much on improving critical thinking, problem solving, communication, team work and better understanding of the concepts among the students. The approach resulted in improved learning abilities of the students and exhibited effective collaborative learning skills. Also, the projects developed provided solutions to the local problems of the society. The success rate of implementation of student-centred approach to impart programming concepts, paved way for following the same approach to teach other programming languages. © 2020, Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology.

This study was conducted at the Laboratory Elementary School of the Indonesia University of Education. The study involved a fifth-grade teacher and 24 students aged between 10 and 11 years who voluntarily enrolled to this study. Data were garnered from field notes, journals, interviews, and learning portfolios. Furthermore, a descriptive approach was employed to analyze and interpret the data to make meaning of the research findings. The results of the study showcase that the implementation of project-based learning with lapbooking could challenge the student participants to develop their creativity by exploring and creating interesting projects.

Industrial designers can work alongside engineers as employees within a company or as outsourced consultants [2]. However, few university courses offer students the opportunity to develop a solution to a current problem with scholars outside of their specific disciplines. Previous initiatives at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) to form multidisciplinary capstone teams with students in the Department of Biomedical Engineering (BME) and students in the School of Design opted to embed a single industrial design (ID) student within a technical group of 3-4 engineers. Although this offered the benefit of multi-disciplinary teams [3], [4], the organizational structure left the ID students' skillsets underutilized. Industrial designers reported in the 2018-2019 academic year that they felt 'useless' when meeting to discuss more technical aspects that [they]¦had no knowledge in. The previous course structure also failed to recapitulate the work dynamic of the workforce where subteams of engineers and industrial designers communicate on an as-needed basis. At specific stages of product development, engineer and ID subteams complete tasks together, while at other times they work independently to generate separate-but-related deliverables [5]. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.","American Society for Engineering Education",21535965,,,"ASEE Annu.

Team-based learning has been shown in previous studies to improve students' academic achievement, persistence, intrinsic motivation, and attitude toward subject areas compared to more traditional methods of learning, and it can be a powerful tool for increasing self-efficacy and experience by allowing students to define their own roles on teams. However, despite the literature supporting team-based learning, it is not a universally positive experience for all students, particularly in cases where team difficulties may intensify pre-existing inequities in the classroom. Because students composing a team can come from vastly different academic backgrounds with different levels of experience with engineering, a team's overall performance may be linked to the performance of students on individual assignments. In this paper, we investigate how individual student performance is related to overall student team performance in a first-year engineering design-build-test-communicate course. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between individual students' ratings of their teams and teammates and the scores earned collectively by the team. Specifically, we analyze student responses to weekly team checks, individual student performance ratings as rated by their teammates, and individual student performance on individual class assignments, and compare these metrics to the overall team grades earned by their respective team. The results suggest a positive, though insignificant, trend between teams with more positive weekly team checks and higher overall team grades. We also find a significant trend between teammates who rate each other highly for 'producing quality work' and earning higher grades on the team project. Furthermore, we find that individual student performance is not significantly correlated with grades earned on the team project. Finally, we observe a negative, though insignificant, trend between teams with a higher standard deviation of individual student exam performances (bigger spread) and overall team grades. That is, teams with more dispersion in exam performance earn lower grades in this sample. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.","American Society for Engineering Education",21535965,,,"ASEE Annu.

Its perceived educational value is exemplified by its explicit mention in ABET's Criterion 5, which requires engineering programs to provide a culminating design experience that incorporates engineering standards and multiple constraints. Capstone courses and design-build-test projects allow students to synthesize and apply engineering knowledge, skills, and tools to open-ended design problems. Students work and communicate in teams to complete tasks like generating requirements, and testing and integrating equipment. There appears to be widespread consensus that project-based learning is valuable, but, how well do these projects prepare students for engineering challenges in professional practice? We consider one aspect of professional practice-failure. Despite many improvement efforts by organizations, systems engineering failures continue to occur. Previous research identified a set of common causes for these project failures. Does PBL provide students with opportunities to fail safely, and thereby learn to avoid failure in professional practice? We present here an approach to compare the rates of occurrence of failure causes in student team projects with industry projects. By comparing the occurrence rates, we achieve our first research goal to evaluate whether PBL offers sufficient opportunities of failure to students. Out of the ten failure causes we examined, we found that four are underrepresented in PBL, two of which are fundamentally related to systems engineering practice. Failure causes may be hard to identify without the benefit of hindsight, so, we developed a set of crowd signals that may point to their presence. We observed 18 different student design projects across two semesters. Each week, the students answered a set of questions we developed to measure these crowd signals, while the instructors directly pointed out any instances of the failure causes they observed during the students' efforts. With the availability of such data we built logistic regression models to find correlations between specific crowd signals and the occurrence of a particular failure cause. By interpreting the regression coefficients, we achieve our second research goal to suggest specific improvements that instructors can use to give their students more failure opportunities during PBL. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.","American Society for Engineering Education",21535965,,,"ASEE Annu.

For senior chemical engineering students, the capstone design course provides an opportunity for students to work in teams to develop their teamwork skills in preparation for their future career. To better emphasize that necessary professional skills, especially teamwork, the Penn State Chemical Engineering capstone design course was redesigned for the 2017-2018 academic year. This paper aims to investigate student perceptions on their teamwork experiences during capstone design yielding insights to further scaffold students in the future. We conducted a questionnaire with both closed- and open-ended items. Descriptive statistics and qualitative coding helped investigate students' perception of the role of teamwork, themes from their reported teamwork experiences, and tensions between the themes. Given the conflicting perspectives on teamwork and problematic experience, conflict resolution strategies were absent from student responses, which we identify as a gap in the student's perceptions of teamwork. Thus, in moving forward, we recommend incorporating conflict resolution into curriculum as a critical part of teamwork. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.","American Society for Engineering Education",21535965,,,"ASEE Annu.

It is therefore important to understand the extent to which these peer ratings may be influenced by unconscious or implicit bias. Unconscious bias during peer ratings is perhaps more likely to occur among first-year students who may have previously had limited interactions with diverse groups, in particular international students. To explore this issue, about 600 student peer ratings in the Comprehensive Assessment of Team Member Effectiveness (CATME) system were examined. The students were participating in a team bridge design project in a first-year civil engineering course. Teams worked together for 3 to 5 weeks and submitted a single written report. After the project was completed, students rated themselves and their peers in CATME. Male and female students were rated similarly overall, as were Hispanic and majority students. However, international students from Middle East countries and China had lower adjustment factor ratings than majority peers. The largest differences were in the contributing category. Middle Eastern students were equally likely to have designed the 'best bridge' on their teams. This is counter evidence to the lower contributing score awarded to Middle Eastern students by their peers and implies that bias may have been present in the peer ratings. In addition, it was found that male Middle Eastern students rated females lower than males. The results imply that first-year courses that include team design projects should spend time discussing unconscious bias and cultural styles. Faculty should also consider these issues when using peer ratings to assign students individual grades from team projects. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.","American Society for Engineering Education",21535965,,,"ASEE Annu.

Bioethanol can also be made from corn, potatoes, rice, beetroot and recently grapes. However, making bioethanol from crops negatively impacts the availability of such products for food consumption. By using organic waste, this project ensures sustainable consumption and production patterns. Converting waste to bioethanol creates a fuel from a biomass that would have been energetically wasted during the decomposition process. Using bioethanol or blending it with gasoline both reduce the reliance on fossil fuel and ultimately reduce the carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere. Thus, it is a truly sustainable transport fuel. In this paper, the design of the bioreactor, instrumentation and automation mechanisms are presented. Kinetics studies and the results from the optimization of the reactor operating conditions area also discussed. Since such work also was carried out as part of engineering technology students' senior capstone project, lessons on project management, budget and schedule development, teamwork, and technical communication will also be presented. Process data were analyzed by biology students to estimate the amount of ethanol produced under various operating scenarios. Biology students also had primary responsibility for selecting and preparing the bioreactor feedstocks. The contributions of the safety management students emphasized to the team the importance of considering safety as part of the design and operation of a process. This multi-disciplinary project emphasizes important aspects of an education that will assist students in the real world. Students must master the language of other disciplines, work together to design and build a system and make sure the system meets the original goals set by the project.

At the onset of the course, many students were apprehensive about the material. From discussions with students, we learned that a number of students did not see connections between this course and courses in their major, or the usefulness of the material in their future careers. Beginning in Fall 2016 several pedagogical changes were incorporated into the course. The full study collected student data to see the effects each aspect had on different student groups. This work in progress paper will examine the student's perceptions of course structure and support based on their demographic information. Prior to this study, the course was taught in 70-100 person sections primarily in a lecture style. Topics in the course were only vaguely connected to their chosen disciple and thus students would struggle to find the benefit in the course. Many students had never programmed before and found the thought process completely foreign. As has been seen at other universities, this contributed to students' lack of engagement and dissatisfaction [1]. Females and minorities are chronically underrepresented in engineering [2] and industry is continually calling for additional engineers [3, 4]. Extensive research has been done on ways to increase student engagement and success in STEM fields [5-7]. The 2012 President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology report Engage to Excel lists these as strongly supported practices: small group discussion and peer instruction, testing, one-minute papers, clickers, problem-based learning, case studies, analytical challenges before lectures, group tests, problem sets in groups, concept mapping, writing with peer review, computer simulations and games, and combinations of active learning methods [8]. Studies have shown that female engineering students cite the availability of external support and group work as supporting their success [9]. We capitalized on that foundation by incorporating a wide range of active learning strategies into an entry-level class creating a more interactive environment to support all students' success. In addition to the classroom environment, student motivations and perceptions can affect outcomes for programming courses. Previous work has been done on several student factors. Initial motivation, goal orientation, and instrumentality were studied by Shell et al as contributing factors [10]. Bergin and Reilly reported on the role of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations and self-efficacy in learning programming [11]. Duckworth has reviewed the role of grit and self-control [12].

Female students cite negative experiences with peers as a major contributor to their dissatisfaction with engineering. Many of these negative experiences occur in team projects that are ubiquitous in engineering programs. In the absence of intentional instruction on teamwork and effective collaboration methods, students-especially women-struggle and have negative experiences that stymie the self-efficacy and confidence-building that should occur during the senior year. The objective of this paper is to highlight key issues with engineering capstone projects and to identify best practices that result in better outcomes for women. This work evolved from the first author's experience in teaching the civil engineering capstone course and from participating in a 'Writing in the Disciplines' group, led by the second author. The group provided a forum for brainstorming ideas and the course provided a platform for testing these strategies. Four recommendations evolved from this effort: 1.) Education on team function and bias in team dynamics is helpful. 2.) Teamwork skills and strategies for collaboration and conflict resolution need to be taught. 3.) Mentoring and engaging with students is an important aspect of the process and can be enhanced to better serve women. 4.) Reflection and self-assessment exercises can be integrated to build self-efficacy and confidence in students. Assessment was done using data collected from mid-term evaluations, peer evaluations, self-assessment exercises, input from industry judges, and teaching evaluations. The major outcome of this study was that instructors can make reasonable modifications to team projects to better serve women. Likewise, students can develop skills that improve their ability to function on teams, leading to better capstone experiences and improved self-efficacy as they enter the engineering workforce. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.","American Society for Engineering Education",21535965,,,"ASEE Annu.

Educators might incorporate industry collaborative organizational structures, but while there are some aspects of collaboration used in industry that faculty can incorporate, often those models are complicated by the need to achieve academic goals. The potential benefits of interdisciplinary teamwork include development of communication skills and the incorporation of and exploration of a multi-layered, more creative solution from different viewpoints, which need to be balanced with students' acquiring and incorporating new material and carving time for assignments that demonstrate student outcomes for accreditation. As the College of Engineering, Architecture, and Technology at Oklahoma State University has strategically planned a shift toward an interdisciplinary senior design focus and dedicated extensive resources to achieve it, they are having to adjust previous course models. The paper will discuss the structure of one long-standing interdisciplinary architectural engineering senior design class within the college in the architecture department, called the Comprehensive Design Studio (AE-CDS), and compare it to developments of the last three semester of the newly developing engineering Interdisciplinary Senior Design projects (ISD) from the perspective of an architecture faculty member who has taught both courses.

Structuring an environment to allow students ample time in a consistent meeting space for iteration and equal communication among all members is a difficult but impactful shift for any team project. Particular to interdisciplinary design work, regular commitment to mentorship by faculty with specialized expertise directly affects student learning and the quality of the solution, as does students' previous experience with skills and teamwork. All of these factors impact departments, not only during senior design, but throughout its curriculum. ISD has made some relevant shifts toward AE-CDS, and interest in ISD in the college has dramatically increased over the past year. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.","American Society for Engineering Education",21535965,,,"ASEE Annu.

It exposes students to the real world, opens an extended inquiry process, and boosts their communication skills and interdisciplinary learning. However, the extant literature on PBL places more emphasis on learning through internal rather than external projects. Industrial collaboration projects build partnerships and provide opportunities to work on real problems, often seeking multidisciplinary approaches. This study explores and suggests the benefits that students derived from their participation in an external research and consultancy project at a University in Oman. Design/methodology/approach: The study follows a qualitative analysis approach founded on an exploratory research design. In-depth interviews were conducted with ten research assistants, two research coordinators, and two project leaders involved in the project. The data from the interview were subjected to the thematic inductive qualitative analysis using Atlas.ti 8 software. Findings: The results of the study revealed that students derived some direct academic benefits, mainly in the area of conducting research. The major learning happened mostly in non-academic areas, for they learned many things necessary for success in real-life work situations. The students benefited largely on behavioural skills and abilities such as communication, self-confidence, English language skills, planning, thinking, and time management skills. Altogether, project-based learning offered them a different skillset beyond what they usually acquire in the conventional teaching and learning environment. Practical implications: The outcomes of this research support the development of curriculum design and instructional pedagogy in higher education in a specific context, concluding that PBL has much to do with the practical aspects of learning and employability. The finding suggests that by engaging in PBL, students can develop certain skills that cannot be acquired in a conventional teaching environment. PBL enables self-learning and prepares students to deal with different situations and challenges on the ground while inculcating professionalism to act in real-life situations. This study advocates the introduction of some PBL based courses in the curriculum to nurture a balanced set of skills and abilities among business students. Social implications: The research outcomes support Oman’s Vision 2040 and one of its strategies for capacity building that aims to adopt innovative methods for individual/collective development of students, as well as for their life-long learning. Originality/value: Project-based learning described in this study provides a pedagogical way to connect university education to a real-life situation. These results offer promising prospects for infusing outdoor multidisciplinary projects in the course curriculum. This work bears significant value for educators in designing curriculum and facilitating projects, particularly in environments where students exhibit weaknesses or inhibitions to receive the knowledge, appropriately, from the conventional mode of teaching. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.",00400912,,,"Educ.

Project-based learning (PjBL) is one of highly effective methods for acquiring knowledge and teaching ""soft"" skills to future employees. This article describes an experimental use of PjBL at a university with a long history of teaching based on traditional methods-the Gdansk University of Technology. The experiment was conducted in the academic year 2017-2018, in collaboration with the city of Wejherowo. The project's main goal was to solve the city's real problems related to climate change, land development and water management. The project was implemented experimentally as part of two subjects: spatial planning, and monitoring and environmental management to ensure an interdisciplinary approach and cover the scope of the project fully. The results of the experiment confirmed the evidence-based advantages of PjBL. However, several methodological, organisational and technical problems, which need to be resolved before a new edition starts, were encountered during the experimental implementation of the method. The experiment was positively received by students, clients, and tutors. To evaluate the impact of PjBL on spatial planning education, the new edition must include a methodological framework for evaluation. © 2020 by the authors.","MDPI",20711050,,,"Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085753359

Background: Capstone courses constitute the culminating experience in engineering curricula. A core characteristic is the student team and project-based nature, with many team deliverables. The ensuing difficulty is to fairly assess the individual team member's contribution toward the team effort. Contribution: The method presented here is based on weekly peer evaluation of the individual team member's contribution, which subsequently yields a participation factor (PF), in turn scaling the team grade in accordance with the individual student performance. Intended Outcome: This method allows the timely adjustment of the individual student effort to match the group expectations and rewards high-performing students by making higher individual grades than the team average possible, while penalizing underperforming free riders by not benefiting from other student's performance. Application Design: The method allows students to continuously calibrate their own and their teammate's expectations and improve their peer score by adjusting their individual efforts. This feedback also requires students to practice professional communication, and in particular giving and receiving critical feedback, and thus is highly aligned with industry needs. Findings: Results evaluated over three iterations of the assessment process indicate a weak positive correlation (0.26) of the peer evaluation with the individual instructor-graded deliverables as well as the individual student grade point average (GPA, 0.23). Further, survey-based data indicate student agreement that the PF is a fair reflection of the individual performance, and a neutral perceived overall assessment system effectiveness, with reported primary barriers being the difficulty in assigning fair peer grades and of open, critical discussion. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",00189359,,IEEDA,"IEEE Trans Educ",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079871081

Background: EPS is a one-semester capstone project framework that adopts project-based learning and multicultural, multidisciplinary teamwork. Educating engineers for sustainable development requires fostering critical and ethical thinking and a desire for equity, solidarity and preservation of natural resources, and cultural and genetic diversity. Existing engineering capstone design programs emphasize solving real world problems, hands-on training, and soft skills, but few focus on sustainability aspects of engineering design. The three Iberian EPS providers adopt project-based learning and teamwork methodologies, promoting the development of transversal skills and addressing sustainability in a multicultural and multidisciplinary background. Intended Outcomes: To show that the three Iberian EPS providers follow these recommendations and contribute to raising students' awareness of sustainable development. Application Design: The proposed sustainability learning assessment method collects evidence from syllabi, project briefs, report templates, and final reports to extract faculty and student perspectives. The sustainability-related terms collected were processed into word cloud format, allowing a simple and intuitive interpretation of students' understanding of sustainability, and in co-occurrence network format, to understand if sustainability has a pervasive or confined presence within the reports. Findings: Iberian EPS faculty and students are aware of the social, economic, and environmental impact of their projects, in terms of quality of life, social responsibility, the use of resources, and environmentally friendly technology. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",00189359,,IEEDA,"IEEE Trans Educ",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069929026

Accordingly, the use of IoT in new agronomic practices might be a vital part for improving soil quality, optimising water usage, or improving the environment. Nonetheless, the implementation of IoT systems to foster environmental awareness in educational settings is still unexplored. This work addresses the educational need to train students on how to design complex sensor-based IoT ecosystems. Hence, a Project-Based-Learning approach is followed to explore multidisciplinary learning processes implementing IoT systems that varied in the sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, plants, soils and irrigation system they used. Three different types of planters were implemented, namely, hydroponic system, vertical garden, and rectangular planters. This work presents three key contributions that might help to improve teaching and learning processes. First, a holistic architecture describing how IoT ecosystems can be implemented in higher education settings is presented. Second, the results of an evaluation exploring teamwork performance in multidisciplinary groups is reported. Third, alternative initiatives to promote environmental awareness in educational contexts (based on the lessons learned) are suggested. The results of the evaluation show that multidisciplinary work including students from different expertise areas is highly beneficial for learning as well as on the perception of quality of the work obtained by the whole group. These conclusions rekindle the need to encourage work in multidisciplinary teams to train engineers for Industry 4.0 in Higher Education. © 2020 by the authors.

Two main reasons are appointed in the literature to this inadequacy. First, they are not able to prepare the actual engineering students to engage in collaborative partnerships (essential skill to deal with real-life engineering problems). Second, they do not promote active learning and are contributing to a compartmentalized curriculum. Since 2007/2008, at the University of Aveiro, two complementary courses on Geotechnical subjects, Soil Mechanics I and II, have been redesigned by complementing traditional teaching with non-traditional learning models.

Team members are geographically spread to assure heterogeneous teams and to promote international cooperation. This paradigm, although very suited for engineering degrees, can be adapted and applied in any project/internship course unit. The results from the first 10 editions of the course that ran between 2009/10 and 2018/19 support our initial hypothesis that Blended-AIM significantly promotes students' soft skills without requiring costly and time consuming changes to prior degree curricula.

PBL is one of the strategies that started to be used in the curriculum of this school as of 2015, mainly in the Special Projects and Activities (PAEs) offered to the students, since the first grade, parallelly to the subjects of the course. The teachers were invited to create activities in the form of projects and workshops in which they had the possibility to make use of their knowledge in order to propose projects that aimed to develop student's competencies. The issue covered in this work is bound to the use of PBL: which are the conceptions of the teachers regarding this strategy and its structuring in the workshops that make use of them? For the analysis, a questionnaire was created, which was answered by the teachers. The results indicate that the basic principles of PBL are fully understood by the teachers, as well as the advantages of their use. However, the structuring of PBL does not follow a line that is in accordance with its classic model. This displacement from the model indicates an adaptation carried out by the teachers that, however, does not put at risk the intelligibility of the model. © 2020 IEEE.","IEEE Computer Society",21659559,9781728109305,,"IEEE Global Eng.

Where manual grading is not possible due to the large number of submissions and the tasks to be assessed are to complex or open-ended to be assessed by machines, peer assessment offers a valuable alternative. However, particularly in the context of MOOCS, courses featuring peer assessments often have lower completion rates. Furthermore, participants with negative expectations and opinions about this form of assessment are generally 'louder' in their communication with the teaching teams than their counterparts who respond more positively. We have, therefore, set out to establish a broader understanding how the participants perceive the appropriateness and effectiveness of peer assessed tasks, and the quality of the received reviews on the X1, X2, and X32 MOOC platforms. For this purpose, we have conducted post-course surveys in a large number of courses that included peer assessments. Additionally, we analyzed the discussions in the forums of these courses as the post-course surveys often are biased due to the low proportion of unsuccessful participants that are still around at the end of a course. 1Massive Open Online Course2The platforms' names have been obscured for double-blind review. © 2020 IEEE.","IEEE Computer Society",21659559,9781728109305,,"IEEE Global Eng.

PBL is a widely known approach that aims to improve motivation and learning by engaging students in investigation with the aim of building a product, solving a problem, or both. Moreover, many studies claim that PBL significantly improves soft skills. This work describes the adaptation of two lower level short-cycle tertiary education programs, in programming and computer engineering, to achieve PBL goals. Qualitative and quantitative studies were carried out in two steps: 1) focus groups with students and instructors and 2) surveys to students that completed an internship and to the respective employers. The intention was to identify the extent to which instructors and students had adopted the new practices and to assess the respective results, as well as to collect employers' opinions about the students' skills and abilities after attending the PBL adapted program. The results of this study showed the need to improve the teaching practices to achieve PBL goals, mainly on soft skills acquisition. We propose recommendations based on two dimensions: institution and instructors. We conclude that the adoption of curriculum innovation at the program level implies a huge commitment from all stakeholders, as well the institution as a whole. In addition, we identify the benefits and difficulties of using PBL regarding motivation, group work, leadership, adaptation, communication, and implementation of more realistic projects. © 2020 IEEE.","IEEE Computer Society",21659559,9781728109305,,"IEEE Global Eng.

Gamification is among the new training methodologies, which is a didactic approach based on the game structure with an attractive component for students. Within gamification, flipped learning and problem-based learning, escape rooms can be found as a technical aspect, which is focused on providing enigmas and tracks for the various educational content that students have assimilated through learning based on problem solving. The aim of this study is to identify how the use of gamification with the use of educational escape rooms affects activation and absence of a negative effect on students. 61 Master students of the Autonomous City of Ceuta participated in this case study. They were divided into three study groups (1 control group; 2 experimental groups) that followed different formative actions (control group—traditional; experimental groups—escape rooms). To achieve the objectives, a mixed research design based on quantitative and qualitative techniques was followed. The instrument used for data collection was the GAMEX (Gameful Experience Scale). The results reveal that the students who had taken a gamified formative action through escape rooms obtained better assessment results in the indicators concerning motivation, teamwork, commitment, activation, and absence of a negative effect on the learning process than those with the traditional methodology. © 2020 by the authors.

To close this gap, this paper aims to investigate the direct effects of team reflection on team performance over time, as well as indirect effects because of the development of similar and accurate team mental models to explain this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Within a longitudinal experimental study on 22 student project teams working on a complex problem-solving task, the effects of repeated team reflection interventions on the development of team performance and team mental models over six measuring times were analysed. Findings: Results show that team reflections caused significant increases in team performance and team mental models over time. Results also provide evidence that team mental models’ quality mediates the effects of team reflections on team performance. Research limitations/implications: The results are interesting for both research fields, team reflection and team mental models, as the findings indicate the merits of recurrent reflection for improving team mental models’ quality. Practical implications: For organisational practice, the question of how reflection processes can be deliberately triggered in teams and effectively integrated into the daily routine should be considered. Originality/value: The findings accentuate the role of team reflections for improving team performance team mental models over time. By continuous reflecting teams increase awareness and insights into effective team processes and strategies (i.e. shared and accurate team mental models), which lead to better performance. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Emerald Group Holdings Ltd.",13527592,,,"Team Perform.

There is little research that has studied interactivity in online PBL settings through the lens of Social Network Analysis (SNA) to explore both student and teacher factors that could help monitor and possibly proactively support PBL groups. This study adopts SNA to investigate how groups, tutors and individual student's interactivity variables correlate with group performance and whether the interactivity variables could be used to predict group performance. Methods: We do so by analyzing 60 groups' work in 12 courses in dental education (598 students). The interaction data were extracted from a Moodle-based online learning platform to construct the aggregate networks of each group. SNA variables were calculated at the group level, students' level and tutor's level. We then performed correlation tests and multiple regression analysis using SNA measures and performance data. Results: The findings demonstrate that certain interaction variables are indicative of a well-performing group; particularly the quantity of interactions, active and reciprocal interactions among students, and group cohesion measures (transitivity and reciprocity). A more dominating role for teachers may be a negative sign of group performance. Finally, a stepwise multiple regression test demonstrated that SNA centrality measures could be used to predict group performance. A significant equation was found, F (4, 55) = 49.1, p < 0.01, with an R2 of 0.76. Tutor Eigen centrality, user count, and centralization outdegree were all statistically significant and negative. However, reciprocity in the group was a positive predictor of group improvement. Conclusions: The findings of this study emphasized the importance of interactions, equal participation and inclusion of all group members, and reciprocity and group cohesion as predictors of a functioning group. Furthermore, SNA could be used to monitor online PBL groups, identify important quantitative data that helps predict and potentially support groups to function and co-regulate, which would improve the outcome of interacting groups in PBL. The information offered by SNA requires relatively little effort to analyze and could help educators get valuable insights about their groups and individual collaborators. © 2020 The Author(s).","BioMed Central Ltd.",14726920,,,"BMC Med.

For a team to work well towards achieving project objectives, it is important that there is effective team communication. Conventionally, face-to-face interactions allow students to interact with each other in multiple communication channels, simultaneously sending and receiving verbal and nonverbal messages in real time. Today, modern mobile technology offers students a variety of alternative digital communication media for collaboration. Unlike a full-channel communication medium such as the face-to-face interaction, a digital communication medium like instant messaging does not normally transmit nonverbal cues. As a result, to compensate for insufficient nonverbal cues, users of instant messaging services have to put more effort and time into understanding each other. If more effort and time is required to understand each other better, then why is it that today’s students prefer instant messaging to face-to-face interactions for collaborative project work? To answer this question, this study conducted a questionnaire survey to collect responses from university students who have been involved in team projects. This study analysed students’ copresence (a second-order formative construct consisting of two first-order constructs: self-copresence and partner-copresence) and its relationships with media satisfaction and communication effectiveness. It investigated whether these relationships differed between the students who used instant messaging and those who used face-to-face interactions. In addition, this study also examined whether media satisfaction played a mediating role between copresence and communication effectiveness.

These include, a lack of inspiring female role-models, limited exposure of girls to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects, gender-biased stereotypes, and preferences for different learning styles between genders. Dedicated to the ideas of women and space, the “She Space” research project for high school girls was a joint effort of the Earth and Planetary Image Facility (EPIF) at Ben-Gurion University in the Negev and Beit Yatziv. The participants included 20 high-school aged female students and a predominantly female staff of up to eight university researchers and advanced degree students. The goal of this project was to advance and support female students engaging with various scientific fields and, in particular, the field of space science. The project emphasized the quality and development of the research process and used project-based learning to help participants learn to use a research-based approach when encountering challenging scientific concepts or subjects. This, together with active learning and teamwork was set as the educational framework to meet the different learning styles and motivational needs of girls. Furthermore, special attention was given to the suppression of gender stereotypes by 1) introducing women role models 2) overcoming self-induced prejudices related to STEM abilities by introducing new and unknown subjects (remote sensing), about which participants lack preconceptions. Using participant surveys, we found that self-reported confidence with and interest in STEM subjects increased after the project. We also found that participants’ feelings about participating in an all-female program did not noticeably change after the program. However, the vast majority (87%) of participants did report that having a majority female staff was very important to them. © 2019 IAA","Elsevier Ltd",00945765,,AASTC,"Acta Astronaut",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076685051

Previous studies observed how students react to various processes and gave retroactive recommendations. In this study, we instead combine a field study on professional Agile (eXtreme Programming, XP) teams and an established team process taxonomy to proactively select team processes to incorporate in a project-based software engineering course. With collected knowledge from the field study, we choose three XP processes to augment the design of a mature software engineering project course. We choose processes that are 1) considered important by professionals, and 2) complete with respect to coverage of the taxonomy's main categories.We then compare the augmented course design with the original design in a case study. Our results suggest that 1) even without extra resources, adding these new processes does not interfere with learning opportunities for XP processes previously existing in the course design; 2) student teams experience similar benefits from these new processes as professional teams do, and students appreciate the usefulness and value of the processes. In other words, our approach allows instructors to make conscious choices of XP processes that improve student learning outcomes while exposing students to a more complete set of processes and thus preparing them better for professional careers. Course designers with limited resources are encouraged to use our methodology to evaluate and improve the designs of their own project-based courses. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Because of this, it is fundamental that the learning of software engineering as an academic discipline provides solid links between theory and practice. Educational frameworks such as those derived from the European Higher Education Area state that student-centered approaches are a useful tool for achieving these objectives. In this context, we present a project-based learning (PBL) experience report in a software engineering program of a Spanish university. The experience is based on the formation of small heterogeneous teams, which face the initial phases of a software methodology during the development of a project close to a real one. Through a strategy of role rotation and documentation transfer, all students perform different tasks and face different challenges throughout the project. Summative assessment is also adopted, considering not only teacher ratings but also students' peer assessment. The results prove the positive effect of using PBL to improve the training of students in acquiring different skills as future software engineers. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Psychological factors, which are habitual patterns of behaviour, thought and emotion, also influence problem-solving skills. This study focuses on investigating the influence of psychological factors like motivation, perception, stress, team working skills, learning styles, general self-efficacy on problem-solving skills of engineering students. This study focused on first-year students of undergraduate engineering program registered for a course titled Engineering Exploration. This course is a three-credit multidisciplinary course that effectively uses Activity-Based Learning (ABL), Design-Based Learning (DBL) and Project-Based Learning (PBL) pedagogical practices. The data collected for the study was through interviews and the use of well-structured questionnaires administered to first-year students enrolled for the course offered at the university. Results show that the psychological factors of students like motivation, perception, general self-efficacy and teamwork skills have a positive influence on problem-solving skills, while stress has a negative effect.

With growing interest in integrating medical MOOCs, their quality must be ensured. This however, has not been studied. We investigated if medical MOOCs meet the instructional design principles: problem-centeredness, activation, demonstration, application, integration, collective knowledge, collaboration, differentiation, authentic resources, feedback, and goal-setting. Methods: An overview of medical MOOCs and inclusion criteria were developed. Out of 410 MOOCs, 33 were selected. A data collection tool was compiled and calibrated. Investigators enrolled in selected MOOCs and coded presence of instructional design principles after examination of all course pages. Results: Application, authentic resources, problem-centeredness, and goal-setting were found to be present in many of the courses. Activation, collective knowledge, differentiation, and demonstration were present in less than half of the courses. Finally, integration, collaboration, and expert feedback were present in less than 15% of the courses. Conclusions: Medical MOOCs meet these principles in varying degree. Certain principles might be scarcely present due to a problematic fit with the MOOC concept or a need for further development in online settings. Assessment of instructional design quality is desired before integrating so that MOOC quality can be considered in relation to the quality of existing campus education. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Background: Internships and capstone projects are widely used to integrate work-related learning in computer engineering curricula. Both activities offer numerous benefits for students, industry, and academia. Although their effects have been extensively studied separately, the interaction between them remains unexplored. Research Questions: What is the effect of internships on the development of a subsequent capstone project? Methodology: The hypothesis was that the completion of an internship will have positive effects on several aspects of the capstone projects: 1) improved student competencies; 2) improved capstone project outcomes; and 3) decreased supervision effort. Further, these positive effects were expected to be greater in industry-based projects than in academic projects. The hypothesis was tested through a quantitative study of data collected from 274 computer science engineering capstone projects. A period of time with internships was compared with another period without internships, and differentiating between academic and industry projects. Findings: Internships prior to capstone projects improve student skills in autonomy, technology, methodology, and project management; increase the complexity and technological novelty of the resulting projects; and reduce advisor involvement in practical (technology, execution) and keep-the-project-alive issues, and increase advisor involvement in monitoring student work (meetings, reports, and initial arrangements). This effect was observed in both industrial and academic projects. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",00189359,,IEEDA,"IEEE Trans Educ",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070375099

In contrast to much of the previous work, this study is not focused on effects; instead, it is aimed at determining the extent to which students perceived various social media platforms as useful within the context of their PBL group work. This study is based on 15 groups (45 tech students) enrolled at Aalborg University and uses the principles of problem-based learning. The study’s procedures included a semi-structured interview guide and a card sorting method. All participants in this study used social media for group coordination. Messenger, Skype, WhatsApp, Snapchat, and Facebook were all used in dynamic, changeable, and different ways within groups for coordination. Moreover, if social media platforms were used for non-academic purposes, they were mostly perceived as not useful and distracting. However, if the social media platforms were perceived as useful, they tended to contain group-and project-relevant content. The various social media platforms were perceived differently and used for different purposes throughout the PBL stages, depending on the individuals, and their use was not persistent or variable due to positive, neutral or negative perceptions. It can also be concluded that real-time synchronous and collaborative platforms are important for facilitating students’ group work and projects. In addition, the students perceived that a strongly focused group with good group dynamics benefits more from using social media than does a more unfocused group with an excessively friendly attitude. © The authors, 2020.","Aalborg University",24463833,9788772103136,,"Int.

The team explored whether a Project-based Learning (PBL) approach in Virtual Design and Construction (VDC) is a feasible method for woman-focused CTE. We found evidence that targeted recruiting through a feminist positive pathway to create a critical mass of female participants in conjunction with PBL can offer an opportunity for women to enter a traditionally male-dominated field. Furthermore, our study calls for continued theory development into and provides evidence that higher concentrations of women have the potential to increase the industry’s focus on safety, environmental protection, and labor standards. We argue that the lack of female representation is due to an opportunity gap for young women to learn about and join high-skill high-wage occupations. © The authors, 2020.","Aalborg University",24463833,9788772103136,,"Int.

Participants came from a four year Honours Bachelor Degree Programme in Civil Engineering and a 90 credit, one year MEngSc. Degree Programme in Information Technology in Architecture, Engineering and Construction. The aim of the split-level (PBL)²-scenario was to improve the education in Building Information Modelling, with a special emphasis on networked working methods. The challenge for BIM-courses is always to expose students to all facets of BIM, i.e. Product Modelling, Process Modelling, Communication amongst interdisciplinary teams, version management and quality control. Recently, the legislator in the U.K. came up with seven new distinct role models for BIM-projects, whereas three of these role models are expected to work on project level and four roles are expected to work on task team level. Different qualifications are required to deliver the activities in excellent quality and to execute the authorities of these roles on an informed basis in a responsible manner. Educators, especially third level institutions, have limited opportunities to expose students to real world scenarios, covering all aspects of a BIM-project. The authors argue, that through the presented split-level arrangement the educational needs in BIM can be covered to the broadest extend possible with a much higher impact than reported in other teaching and learning scenarios. © The authors, 2020.","Aalborg University",24463833,9788772103136,,"Int.

From a literature analysis, some works were found where risks and metrics for DGS projects are proposed, but it was evidenced that some risks are not described in detail, they are ambiguous and hard to understand, which makes it difficult to know which category they belong to. In addition, it is necessary to classify risks in a less-subjective way, which allows to improve their understanding and thus define and apply measurement tools to obtain the impact magnitude of mentioned risks, and generate some indicators for support decision-making in DGS teams. In this article, 37 risks for the communication, cooperation and coordination in the DGS are proposed, as a result of the comparison and integration of identified risks in the literature. A set of metrics defined with the application of the Goal Question Metric (GQM) paradigm is also presented, organized according to these questions: What does it measure? Where the attribute to be measured is established; How to measure it? Where the metric is formulated through the following elements: description, type, scale and calculation function. Through the focus group technique, its completeness, relevance, clarity, precision, and ease of use were evaluated. The proposed metrics could be useful for organizations, teams, projects, and consultants operating in DGS contexts. © 2020, Revista Facultad de Ingenieria.

The result of this exercise indicated that the differences that exist between business and educational software necessitate the development of a new software development model that is specifically tailored to the development of educational software. Therefore, capability maturity model integration (CMMI) was modified to generate a new version of CMMI - named educational CMMI - which could be used to evaluate educational software projects and detailed mathematical descriptions of the proposed model were composed.

One defined learning methodology that applies well to design education is project-based learning. In an attempt to better understand the patterns of project-based learning in different design-related programs, we studied three small groups of teachers and students at an innovative academy based out of Shanghai Institute of Visual Art, entitled De Tao Master's Academy, and compared their education style to that of subjects in regular programs at Shanghai Institute of Visual Art. Our goal was to seek patterns of cognitive apprenticeship in our subjects' education, and find out (a) if it's more effective than the traditional approach, and (b) can modelling (i.e. direct replication of learned material) be excluded from a design curriculum. The information gathered through surveys, interviews and observation were segmented into six categories: (1) selfregulation, (2) creative thinking and thinking styles, (3) incorporation of cognitive apprenticeship model into teaching style, (4) teaching hours vs. self-learning, (5) individual vs. team work preference, and (6) learning environment and teaching resources. We found that self-regulation was uniformly low throughout the sample, but that De Tao curriculum aimed to increase it over the course of their programs. Most students preferred small teams, with less than 5 students to do assignments and projects with, instead of individually working or working in large teams. Curriculum and interviews indicated De Tao programs had a higher focus on teaching creative thinking and independence, which reflected on design self-efficacy scores of their students when compared with SIVA students. Learning spaces at De Tao were observed to be better, and their instruction constructed close to cognitive apprenticeship. Coaching, scaffolding, articulation and exploration were evident in the design education methods adopted at De Tao. The ethnographic findings were related into an evolved social cognitive design framework, which allowed us to preliminarily contextualize design learning influencers.

Capstone design programs are effective environments for students to collaborate with industry sponsors on authentic design problems. They provide students with the opportunity to hone their technical and professional skills, often in teams. Previous work has demonstrated that interdisciplinary teams outperform within-discipline teams on complex open-ended tasks, but struggle to communicate across disciplinary boundaries. They also report lower levels of team cohesion and satisfaction with final outcomes. The results of the mixedmethods study conducted with 58 capstone design teams for this paper indicate that team diversity may be inversely related to students' beliefs in their abilities to construct a prototype. Preliminary qualitative analysis suggests that students tend to divide prototyping tasks based on disciplinary background and struggle to integrate design efforts for complex systems, particularly during later stage design.

Because of this, the design community has been invested in devising and assessing empathic design activities. However, research on empathy has been primarily limited to individuals, meaning we do not know how it impacts team performance, particularly in the concept generation and selection stages of the design process. Specifically, it is unknown how the empathic composition of teams, average (elevation) and standard deviation (diversity) of team members' empathy, would impact design outcomes in the concept generation and selection stages of the design process. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to investigate the impact of team trait empathy on concept generation and selection in an engineering design student project. This was accomplished through a computational simulation of 13,482 teams of noninteracting brainstorming individuals generated by a statistical bootstrapping technique drawing upon a design repository of 806 ideas generated by first-year engineering students. The main findings from the study indicate that the elevation in team empathy positively impacted simulated teams' unique idea generation and selection while the diversity in team empathy positively impacted teams' generation of useful ideas.

The evaluation framework is designed based on the Context-Input-Process-Product (CIPP) model and applied in an interdisciplinary BIM capstone project at Chongqing Jiaotong University. Four project teams with a total of 52 students from 9 different majors were involved in the highway and its service area design after centralized training. Mixed research methods were used for data collection, including a questionnaire survey for students and semi-structured interviews for team leaders and instructors through purposive sampling. The results indicate that: (1) all students have a deep awareness and interest in learning BIM and joint design; (2) BIM software training and its theoretical knowledge should be incorporated into BIM capstone courses; (3) BIM coordination meetings in the design process play an important role in reducing model collisions and redesign work while the instructor’s performance has no significant impact on this aspect; and (4) prior knowledge of teamwork experience has the greatest correlation with performance of joint design.

As design methodology expands be-yond traditional practice contexts, designers ability to work in complex multi-disciplinary teams and collaborative environments is increasingly relevant. This paper re-evaluates a series of inter-year team project modules introducing students to collaborative working. Carried out from 2010 to 2013, previous research explored how past teamwork experiences influence future team behaviour and what learning is reapplied. This led to identification of difficulties and moderating factors in these projects, and subse-quent improvements in the modules and advice given to students. New research carried out from 2019 to 2020 confirms previous insights into positive reported impacts on personal student evolution and better understanding of good teamwork practice. At the same time the experiential learning identified by students has changed, and issues such as time-related stress, divergence of experiences and pas-sion/motivation are emerging. While these findings relate to team-working in one design school, the prolonged experience of heterogeneous team-working in the school and the cross-sectional approach help to highlight emerging issues that may be important design education in the future. © International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education, E and PDE 2020.All right reserved.","The Design Society",,9781912254101,,"Proc.

In comparing PBL with traditional methods, the results reveal statistically significant differences in aspects such as academic performance. Teamwork, oral communication, written communication and students’ perceptions of the learning experience were also all favoured.

The article analyses an iterative game development process in an online learning context. The empirical data is primarily based on an explorative case study of “Games for change”; a course held in 2018 in which master students from the international Nordic Visual Studies and Art Education (NoVA) design games that address issues in society. Throughout the course, the students from universities in Finland, Sweden and Denmark engaged in a cross-cultural collaboration across campuses. The purpose of the study was to explore how to establish an online space for joint design inquiry in the context of ‘games for change’ across time and space as well as cultural and professional barriers. The data used for analysis includes teaching observations, videos of play sessions, photos and visual representations, students’ reflection papers and students’ written and oral evaluations after completion of the course. The analysis is based on different problem-based learning (PBL) activities; lectures, video instructions, presentation-and feedback sessions, reflexive exercises and students’ self-directed design and learning processes in groups. As part of the game course, teachers presented game theory and exercises through videos and visualisations to support the students’ iterative game design processes. The analysis of the PBL activities shows that teachers’ video instructions relating theoretical game concepts to the students’ actual group work supported the introduction to the game field as well as their design processes. The balance between the value of video instructions with specific feedback and teachers’ time for preparation is a relevant issue for further exploration in online teaching. Moreover, findings show that the students’ visualisations and video productions exemplifying game situations created a visible reference point for further discussions in feedback sessions across campuses, which guided game development. Thus, the combination of inquiry approaches, critical game theory and design processes combined with students’ visualisations and video productions provides interesting connections for bridging gaps between cultures and professions, e.g. in art and games. By the rich and visual descriptions of PBL activities, student work and reflective evaluations, the exploratory case study can function as inspiration for applying similar approaches to new local contexts in higher education. © ACPIL.","Academic Conferences and Publishing International Limited",14794403,,,"Electron.

These projects allow students to practice behaviors and roles to support their engineering identity development and sustained participation in STEM. However, such projects can also have negative impacts on students from underrepresented populations. Multiple studies of women’s experiences on such teams point to unequal gender dynamics and negative experiences. Few studies, however, have focused on racial dynamics. To fill this gap, the current study uses phenomenology to explore the experiences of African American males on multiracial student engineering teams. Eight African American male engineering students were interviewed three times over the course of a semester as they worked on team projects. Intergroup contact theory (ICT), a social science theoretical framework based on the contact hypothesis to reduce anxiety between distinct social groups via interaction under specific conditions, informed the study design. Overall, participants described positive team experiences that included personal interactions and significant awareness of the negative stereotypes about African Americans in engineering and society. The participants also described a lack of friendship opportunity and conflict associated with unmet expectations. Interestingly, participants described their proactive effort to dispel negative stereotypes. Emergent themes are discussed as well as implications for faculty’s approach to student teams or unconscious bias of teammates. © 2020 by Begell House, Inc. www.begellhouse.com.","Begell House Inc.",10728325,,,"J.

Flipped learning implies the transfer of assessment in a more formative direction and targeted feedback that is frequently delivered. On the contrary, teaching resources are decreasing. Increasing the portion of self-, peer- and automatic assessment partially helps solving this dilemma. Currently, Tampere University is in the midst of the process of combining two separate campuses together. Both campuses offer major-specific computer science studies. This paper presents a case study of merging basic level web technology courses, and in particular their different assessment practices together. The courses are targeted for the second- and third-year students, and the number of participants is about 200 in the studied course (enrolled N=324 / completed N=178). The merged course was run in two learning management systems (LMSs), called Plussa and WETO. The switch from one LMS to another happened in the middle of the course. LMSs employed different assessment practices for weekly exercises: Plussa assessed them automatically, whereas WETO exploited peer-reviews. This provided a unique opportunity to compare these two assessment methods and the study addresses the pedagogical opportunities and challenges of both.

Distributed teams can also be difficult to manage, and their members can face extra adversities in communication. Architecture, Engineering and Construction Industry (AEC), is a context where the use of distributed teams is growing significantly, particularly through the enabling features of Building Information Modelling (BIM) methodologies. This paper was aimed at the diagnosis of communication behaviour in distributed teams in the context of a PBL methodology that requested students to work in distributed teams on two distinct locations. For that, the authors managed a workshop on Lean Project Management and Collaborative Tools in the European Master in Building Information Modelling (BIM A+) using a Lego for Scrum activity, adapted to a team of students distributed in Portugal and Slovenia. After that, nine distributed teams of students had to design exposition pavilions in BIM platform and using collaborative tools.

Thus, PBL has the students as the main object, enabling them to decide on real-life focus situations, proposing, through teamwork, solutions to problems and/or getting the most of the opportunities. PBL promotes enjoyable learning, allowing the direct mandatory participation of students, teachers and the owners of the real-life situations under consideration, as well as the eventual participation of other relevant stakeholders. However, in most cases, the choice of teams is made manually by the teacher, through criteria that many times result in lack of coherence and equity between the project teams. This undesirably affects the overall group performance due to conflicts, communication gaps and lack of transparency. In this paper, a flexible module is proposed to digitize and automate team-building processes, based on students' preferences and competences. This module, called Team Building through Student's Preferences and Competences (TBSPC), may be applied to any type of PBL project and offers to students the possibility to contribute in the PBL team pre-creation phase, allowing their decision-making based within some settings previously established by teachers. This makes PBL teams coherent, complementary and congruent with the project. The effectiveness of the mechanisms for creating teams and their impact on the teams' performance in PBL courses are a focus for the TBSPC module development in the context of the Brazil and Tunisia partnership. This module will be part of the Platform for Unifying Methodologies of Active learning (PUMA) which is a platform for centralization and automation of PBL processes for university courses. © 2020 University of Minho.

The model contains two novel elements: a Project Value Map for guiding, judging and benchmarking value throughout a project; and a formative feedback process called the Many Eyes Process. The Project Value Map is a teaching tool that provides a common language for describing, discussing and comparing the value of project work across many varied projects and stakeholders; and the Many Eyes Process generates feedback from multiple perspectives to guide the team in project decision-making. The Many Eyes Process is informed by four key stakeholder perspectives: self-evaluation, a ‘shadow’ perspective, a teaching assistant (TA) perspective and a client perspective. The Many Eyes Process is run during three Project Audit Weeks, spaced throughout the 12-week semester. The output from the Many Eyes Process provides both quantitative and qualitative feedback to the team and its stakeholders. The combination of the Project Value Map with the Many Eyes Process helps align all stakeholder expectations over the duration of the project and provides formative feedback information to enable teams to reliably benchmark a final team grade for themselves. This suggests that an emphasis on a formal, constructive, and qualitative formative feedback processes during capstone design projects helps students deliver value in their project. © 2020 TEMPUS Publications.","Tempus Publications",0949149X,,,"Int.

This paper presents the use of learning analytics for assessing individual contributions in a team project. The core of this framework is Moodle, a Learning Management System (LMS), that has the ability of monitoring and recording all the actions generated by students. It includes several Learning Analytics plugins, which help analyze and visualize the data collected. Based on these activities and event logs and interactions, the individual work and performance in a project is identified, which helps the teacher make a fair evaluation of the student.

But the agile methods were initially designed for use in small, single-team projects and routines for coordination between several teams have not been adopted in the same way as routines for coordination within the team. The Scaled Agile Framework has become the most common way to implement organizational routines for inter-team coordination, but critiques claim it to be too strict and formal, without leeway for adaption. This study investigates the dynamics of inter-team coordination routines at three organizations and provides thick descriptions of tailoring. Data collection was performed by 379 hours of observations and 28 interviews. The main findings highlight the variety in ostensive and performative aspects of coordination routines and how they change over time. Contrary to earlier findings, the ostensive and performative aspects in this study do not have opposing varieties. This indicates that the empirical relationship between ostensive and performative aspects might not be as atypical as previous results suggest. An important practical contribution is the described possible tailoring options when scaling up agile ways of working which contradict the view of the framework being too rigid. © 27th European Conference on Information Systems - Information Systems for a Sharing Society, ECIS 2019.

Background As the popularity of Scrum has grown, its roles and ceremonies have been utilized in student software projects, yet one of the more challenging roles to implement in the academic context is the role of BPO. Consequently, alt-hough the BPO role is central to Scrum, this role is lacking in many student Scrum projects. Methodology Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected at a large university in the U.S. to assess the effectiveness of attempted improvements in incorpo-rating the BPO role in 32 student Scrum projects. Contribution This study is among the first to theorize and examine the bottom-up selec-tion of BPOs where team members select their own BPOs as a unique pro-ject requirement. This study extends current theory to expand the develop-ment team roles when BPOs are unable to articulate requirements during co-creation activities. This study also informs us of the impact of BPO attributes on team member perceptions and it demonstrates how BPO engagement can be improved in student Scrum projects. Findings The findings suggest that BPO engagement can be improved by (a) formaliz-ing the BPO selection process through time-limiting responses, screening, and contractual agreements, (b) starting the BPO initiation process through co-creation activities (e.g., user story workshop), and (c) expanding the devel-opment team's role in defining and prioritizing features during the BPO exe-cution process through mutual steering. Recommendations for Practitioners Based on the findings, practitioners are recommended to educate BPO's con-cerning their role and its impact on the Scrum team. Recommendations for Researchers Researchers are recommended to develop and test additional mechanisms to facilitate ongoing BPO engagement. Impact on Society Higher education needs to explore more ways of involving practitioners in student projects. Future Research Future research should explore ways of reducing BPO attrition in student Scrum projects. © 2020, Informing Science Institute.","Informing Science Institute",15479714,,,"J. Inf.

This was possible with the help of information technology advances, which led to the creation of Blackboard Learn, a Learning Management System (LMS). By transitioning their systems to this newly developed LMS, the western branch colleges of Qassim University in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia were able to support e-learning. To investigate the influence of online learning e-courses on educational institutions and learning outcomes, this paper intends to perform surveys on both faculties and students. The survey mainly focuses on course objectives, practical skills, faculty member's responses regarding query and discussion, explanations on applied courses, problem-solving, and improving teamwork skills. A comprehensive investigation of the faculties reveals that 59.08% of faculty members believe it is challenging to facilitate course objectives due to the lack of practical lab work and other detailed knowledge exchange on applied courses, which leads to the faculties being unsatisfied with online courses when compared with traditional systems. Moreover, 77.17% of the students think it is difficult to have discussions during online courses in order to solve queries, and this diminishes their problem-solving capability. In addition, with an online course system, there is no way to physically collaborate in teams and work on team projects to improve teamwork abilities. © 2020 Science and Information Organization.","Science and Information Organization",2158107X,,,"Intl.

Project-Based Learning (PjBL), in its nature as a pedagogical method, has the capability of harnessing the potential of students in soft skills. The purpose of this study was to develop a PjBL conceptual framework for integrating soft skills among students of technical colleges. The population goal for the study was made up of 372 technical teachers from 22 government technical colleges across the sample area. Considering the heterogeneous complexity of the population from which the survey is extracted, the stratified technique of random sampling was used to choose the 295 participants for the study. Through Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) models the chi-square values, modification indices, and standardized estimates were developed using Analysis Moment of Structures (AMOS). Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to check the model's causal relationship by the application of AMOS version 20. The study findings revealed PjBL preparation (planning), application, commitment, and assessment techniques each to have a positive significant impact on soft skill improvement among students of technical colleges. On the other hand, the study found that facilitation in project-based learning has a significant yet negative relation to integrating soft skills among students at the technical colleges. Interestingly, the outcome of this research suggests that PjBL in technical colleges will have a substantial positive impact on the integration of soft skills among the students.

Virtual patients represent a factual basis of problem-based learning. This review article focuses on the use of this educational technology for the development of medical decision making skills internationally, on its pedagogical effectiveness, and on the variants of the linear and branching scenarios. Meta-analyses demonstrate the pedagogical effectiveness of virtual patients and an interest of the trainees. An integration of the virtual patients into the learning contributes to clinical training gamification, which inspires the students and medical doctors to engage in interactivity and teamwork. The creation of a repository or a web-service of multimedia virtual patients in the tradition of national clinical school is of great current interest for implementation in the system of higher and continuing medical education. © 2020 Siberian State Medical University.

These projects require significant collaboration and, as such, the project's success is largely dependent on the students' teamwork. This work presents an exploratory study of capstone design teams in a large engineering school in Canada. The goal of the study was to draw valuable insights about the teamwork experiences, skills and gaps of students in capstone design teams. These insights will support evidence-based development and improvement of teamwork training for engineering students. The study was conducted in two phases. First, semi-structured interviews with 12 instructors of capstone design courses solicited their perspectives on students' capstone design teams. Findings from the instructor interviews and related literature were used to design a student survey. The survey was administered to more than six hundred fourth-year engineering students to further explore capstone design teams' dynamics.Wecollected information on students' team formation, distribution of tasks and roles in teams, project management methods used, and the different types of conflicts experienced. In addition, we investigated the potential links between those variables and team effectiveness and enjoyment. In general, our results provide strong evidence that having clear roles, a high degree of a match between students' interests and skills with their assigned tasks, similar expectations about the outcomes, a clear project management plan, and lower levels of conflicts in student teams are significantly correlated with perceived team effectiveness and enjoyment. We discuss the implications of our findings for targeted instructional interventions on required teamwork skills for students. © 2020 TEMPUS Publications.","Tempus Publications",0949149X,,,"Int. J.

Research, however, has shown that graduates still fall short of the expectations of industry. These deficiencies are not limited to technical shortcomings. The ever changing landscape of 'lean' enterprise software development requires engineers to be equipped with abilities beyond the technical. How can higher education help students become great software developers in this context? As a first step towards answering this question, we present the results of a systematic literature review, focusing on noncognitive abilities, better known as 'soft skills'. Our results identify self-reflection, conflict resolution, communication, and teamwork as the top four taught skills. Internships and capstone projects require more attention as a teaching aspect to facilitate the learning of multiple skills, including creativity. Interdisciplinary teaching and group composition are other important factors that influence learning. By providing novel insights on relationships between noncognitive abilities and teaching aspects, this work contributes to the continuous improvement of software engineering curricula. These findings may also serve as a springboard for further investigation of certain undervalued skills. © 2020 SEFI 47th Annual Conference: Varietas Delectat...

The author of this paper has previously examined such analogies critically in connection with his own research concerning the actual patterns of decision-making in a music performance. One conclusion from this research is that these patterns are, to a large extent, generalizable to decision-making in other group contexts. At the same time, however, analogies always “hide” and “highlight” certain aspects of what they are meant to say something about (to repurpose vocabulary from George Lakoff & Mark Johnson's Metaphors We Live By [1]). Exploring the limits of an analogy may consequently lead to a clearer idea of the special traits of each of the two compared entities. This paper uses the critical examination of an analogy between a small music ensemble (such as a rock band) and a team of engineering students to emphasize where the two fundamentally differ in their decision-making patterns. At a first glance, the way musicians base their actions in a performance on a combination of goals (broadly construed), expectations for the actions of others, internalized routines, and prior communication with exact agreements, is very close to that of a team of engineering students. Where the two differ is especially in the way goals emerge and are negotiated in a group.

Hence, there is an evident need for developing life-long learning skills and particularly in fostering self-regulation of learning in engineering programmes. Project-Based Learning (PjBL) is a teaching pedagogy that supports the development of intellectual skills and autonomy through self-regulation. Individual self-regulation of learning has been studied over the years in a range of education situations [7,14]. As teamwork becomes commonplace in education, the need to study team regulation has become apparent and models that include social and cognitive processes during teamwork have emerged [2]. However, new empirical evidence is still required to develop models of shared regulation in groups. This study builds on the body of empirical evidence about shared regulation focusing on Project-Based Learning environments. It investigates how teams of engineering students actually develop shared team regulation and how this is related to individuals' self-regulation. The study uses data from students' project meetings during a one-semester long project as part of a Chemical Process design course. As the emphasis of the study is in describing and analysing how shared regulation takes place within a group context, focusing the attention on verbal and non-verbal mechanisms as indicators of shared regulation displayed by the students; naturalistic data of teams of students are gathered while carrying out PjBL meetings (~5) via video recording (~10 hours). Transcripts of conversations/actions are coded in the first instance to describe what takes place and then to support the analysis. These data enable the identification of elements of regulatory behaviour as displayed through language. © 2020 SEFI 47th Annual Conference: Varietas Delectat...

The current study demonstrates that VR and 3D prototyping in the context of project-based learning (PBL) promote effective communication, increase problem solving skills, and enhance learning outcomes. VR and digital prototyping have been extensively used in industries for the purpose of product design and usability evaluation. In the context of engineering education, many research studies have attempted to explore the effect of VR on teamwork, engagement, retention, and motivation. In this paper, VR is used in conjunction with PBL in self-directed approach to design and implement a product using 3D software whilst also using virtual reality immersive CAVE display to evaluate their design. The hypothesis is that the use of VR with a project-based-learning approach to facilitate the attainment of desirable goals in the engineering design project, improved achievement of course learning outcomes and promoted effective communication. According to the research findings, VR approach significantly affected the distribution of cumulative project grades. Students’ project grades improved, particularly the implementation component. In addition, the course outcomes related to project design were better achieved in VR approach. The communication and problem-solving skills were improved in the VR approach as compared to traditional approach. © 2019, The Author(s).","Springer",13807501,,MTAPF,"Multimedia Tools Appl",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076378089

It was reported as bearing both positive and negative effects on the innovation capabilities of science and engineering students, learning in a traditional classroom. As web-based technologies are becoming prominent in higher education, there is a need to examine this effect among students working in online learning environments. Hence, this study was set to characterize team diversity of science and engineering students, and identify factors that might predict innovation in team projects conducted in different learning environments. This study was carried out in the settings of a nanotechnology course, delivered both on-campus and as a massive open online course (MOOC). The study compared between three groups of learners: face-to-face (F2F) university students (n = 103), online university students (n = 108), and MOOC learners (n = 109). The number of participants in each group is derived from the number of team projects that were submitted and analyzed. Applying a quasi-experimental research design, data were collected via a survey and analysis of projects' innovation. Findings showed that diversity in ‘academic discipline’ and ‘academic level’ were positive predictors of project innovation, in all three groups. Diversity in ‘mother tongue’ was found as a positive predictor of innovation for the face-to-face university students, but as a negative predictor for both online groups. Potential explanations for the differences observed between face-to-face and online learners are presented. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Elsevier Ltd",03601315,,COMED,"Comput Educ",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072617725

However, past research has identified that working with other students online has the potential to cause anxiety for learners, particularly when work is being assessed. There is concern that, as well as the emotional distress this may cause, anxiety may affect students' participation and performance in these activities. This paper investigates these issues by exploring part-time distance learners' experiences of a group project where they were required to collaborate online to create a wiki resource and a website. An online survey and interviews were conducted with students who had recently completed the project. Results revealed that anxiety was commonly experienced, and causes of anxiety included relying on ‘unknown others’, fear of negative evaluation, and worries about non-active group members. It was found that anxiety reduced over the course of the project, as feelings of uncertainty were resolved. Findings also revealed that, although anxiety is often viewed to have detrimental consequences, more learners perceived anxiety to have had a facilitative effect on participation and performance than a debilitative one. Students who employed problem-focused coping strategies, rather than avoidance coping ones, were more likely to experience facilitative effects. These findings will be of value to educators who are designing and running online collaborative activities, and students who are participating in them. © 2019","Elsevier Ltd",03601315,,COMED,"Comput Educ",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071884263
