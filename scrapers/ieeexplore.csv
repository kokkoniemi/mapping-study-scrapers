The experiment and evaluation were made on the Software Engineering (SE) students in second year who enrolled in the 977-271 Requirement Engineering and System Modeling (RESM) course, semester 1/2019. The result shows that the students were able to think, analyse, integrate and apply the knowledge and skills achieved from the lecture to the real practice in problem-solving based on the industrial case study. They were able to achieve the necessary LOs for the RE course in both specific (hard) and generic (soft) skills. Furthermore, this II-PrBL resulted in the high perceived effectiveness of students' learning and the strong level of satisfactory teaching.","","978-1-7281-9570-4","10.1109/iSTEM-Ed50324.2020.9332770","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9332770","Industrial-Infused Project-Based Learning;II-PrBL;Case-Based Learning;Industrial Problem-Based Learning","Education;Systems modeling;Requirements engineering;Problem-solving;Software engineering;STEM","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;formal specification;software engineering;systems analysis;teaching","learning outcomes;software engineering students;high perceived effectiveness;requirement engineering;teaching;industrial-infused project-based learning","","","","12","","1 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While entrepreneurship and PBL in SE education are thrilling research topics, there seems to be very little work focusing on the pros and cons of involving external stakeholders to support real demands in software engineering education. Working on real projects also supports students to acquire leadership skills, such as communication, project management, and teamwork. This paper describes a case study integrating students from different Software Engineering programs and involving external stakeholders, underpinned by PBL concepts. We present how this study was designed and implemented in a large institution, in four steps, summarized as follows: (I) requirements gathering and design; (II) information system development and implementation; (III) integration tests and deployment process; (IV) support and maintenance activities. The study had the participation of 59 students from a professional technical course in step one, working in teams, and 10 undergraduate students from a Bachelor's program in Information Systems in the following steps, working in pairs. Overall, the feedback from stakeholders and students exceeded expectations, although it increased the workload of teachers. We were able to distill a new set of lessons learned, and we expect that at least some of them will be useful for anyone implementing a similar course. As a consequence of this study, we plan to institutionally formalize the PBL course improvement process by defining specific outcomes and measurements.","","978-1-6654-0138-8","10.1109/ICSE-SEET52601.2021.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9402166","Project-Based Learning, PBL, Software Engineering Education, External Stakeholders","Training;Project management;Maintenance engineering;Teamwork;Stakeholders;Software engineering;Information systems","computer aided instruction;computer science education;continuing professional development;educational courses;educational institutions;further education;information systems;software engineering","project-based learning;student-centered approach;SE education;software engineering education;software engineering programs;requirement gathering;undergraduate students;PBL course improvement process;information system development;leadership skill acquisition;requirement design;information system implementation;learn-by-doing approach;integration tests;deployment process;support activity;maintenance activity;professional technical course","","1","","30","","7 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is a six-credit course of fourteen weeks duration, designed for undergraduate students of Electrical and Electronics Engineering. This paper presents the course structure, project planning and feedback from students. The experience gained by designing and implementing this course will be used to develop improved courses for higher semesters for this batch of students. The overall objective is to help students to design Analog Circuits using discrete electronic components and simple integrated circuits and sensitize them on sustainability goals like power saving by using low power and low-cost components, optimized designs, standard practices and solutions that are useful for society. The Goals, Activities, Products and Assessment (GAPA) for the course are interlinked and logistics planning has been done before the commencement of the semester. The curriculum has been developed to cover the concepts required for developing sustainable products, and the topics discussed involve low power amplifiers, oscillators, wave shaping circuits and filters. The students registered for this course have experienced PBL in their previous semesters and have successfully completed a prerequisite course named Fundamentals of Automation Engineering. They are skilled on using the electronic test and measurement equipment, designing Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) and soldering of electronic components on the boards. Although they are granted autonomy in selecting components and circuit design, project goals are identified by the instructor and evaluation weightage assigned consciously to these goals. Activities are conducted during sessions to help students learn the concepts required for the gradually developing the project. Feedback is required from the students to compare the planned goals versus achieved goals and is analyzed for pluses and deltas. It is also used to monitor the motivation of students, to make the course more interesting for intrinsic learning.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9273954","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9273954","Project Based Learning (PBL);Goals-Activities-Products- Assessments (GAPA","Software;Integrated circuit modeling;Analog circuits;Planning;Layout;Solid modeling;Printed circuits","computer aided instruction;educational courses;electronic engineering computing;electronic engineering education;printed circuits","project goals;planned goals;achieved goals;intrinsic learning;six-credit course;fourteen weeks duration;undergraduate students;electronics engineering;course structure;project planning;designing implementing;improved courses;higher semesters;analog circuits;discrete electronic components;simple integrated circuits;sustainability goals;low-cost components;standard practices;logistics planning;semester;sustainable products;low power amplifiers;wave shaping circuits;previous semesters;prerequisite course;automation engineering;electronic test;measurement equipment;soldering;circuit design;progress-research;printed circuit boards;PCB;PBL","","","","6","","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The students work in collaboration as a team of four from varying years and disciplines of engineering and implement a 'Theme' - a gamified robotics problem statement over the course of six months. Previous studies of e-Yantra competition have shown that the competition has been successful in teaching students new and high-level concepts of embedded systems and robotics in effective manner through a learning by competing approach. Over the course of various editions of the competitions, e-Yantra has collected a huge corpus of participants and their respective performances in the competition. This paper analyzes and discusses the outcomes of the data collected over a three-year period (2016-2018) and draws inferences from it. It successfully demonstrates that students in an online Project Based Learning environment receive a functional upgrade in the knowledge of robotics. While most project based learning studies have generally been restricted to a rather small sample size, this is one of the few quantitative study that deals with a large number of students who are not in a classroom environment. This approach also facilitates cooperative and collaborative learning in addition, it further encourages and develops intra-personal and inter-personal skills. A key recommendation of the study is to make Project Based Learning competitions like e-Yantra to be more ingrained in the college curriculum. Such competitions can be introduced in universities with incentives such as extra credits and certifications and hence will enable active participation of students in the engineering studies.","2165-9567","978-1-7281-0930-5","10.1109/EDUCON45650.2020.9125379","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9125379","project based learning;data analysis;online education;robotics;online competition","Embedded systems;Conferences;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Engineering education;Robots;Certification","computer aided instruction;control engineering computing;control engineering education;educational courses;embedded systems;Internet;robots;teaching","e-Yantra Robotics Competition;digital pedagogy;hands-on practical medium;gamified robotics problem statement;e-Yantra competition;embedded systems;collaborative learning;engineering studies;e-Yantra project;premier technical institute;Indian Institute of Technology Bombay;learning outcome analysis;project-based learning engagement;massive online competition;learning competitions;online project based learning environment;massive online robotics competition;cooperative learning;intrapersonal skills;interpersonal skills","","3","","16","","25 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The demands placed on modern engineers are to navigate and act upon competing priorities set by clients, regulating bodies, environmental groups, and the public at large to solve the problems of modern society. For engineering students to be prepared for the challenges they will face in their careers, they need to gain experience working in a dynamic environment to solve projects and problems that diverge from the theoretical realm and enter a practical landscape similar to what they will encounter in industry. One way is with an on-campus project-based learning (PBL) center. A PBL Center uses a pedagogical strategy where student learning centers around projects under the guidance of faculty mentors. The PBL Center also functions to allow industry and community partners to engage with faculty and student interns. The Concept Center at Weber State University is modeled after PBL pedagogy and functions to connect student interns employed at the center with sponsored projects. This paper discusses the application of PBL in the Concept Center to achieve a double mission of supporting industry and providing opportunities for students to gain experience in technology.

This paper describes an experiment conducted to improve the learning experiences of the students enrolled in the Computer Science bachelor's degree course, attending three curricular units: Information Systems Development, Data Structures, and Web Languages and Technologies. The approach followed by the teachers used project-based learning as an active learning methodology. This methodology allows us to achieve four main objectives: (i) improve student engagement; (ii) improve learning outcomes achievement (iii) increase the course success rate and (iv) allow students to experience the need for the software development lifecycle, feeling that software engineering is not a block-based process but depending on previous activity, often leads to the need to go back in the process.

Data Science projects can be thought to be similar to CS projects, but there are some key particularities that require a specific account of PBL for data science. PBL has clear benefits for engaging students to apply technical knowledge learned in other courses, address relevant industry problem-solving, provide space for multiple pathways to a given solution, and foster the collaboration with other students developing inter-personal and competitive skills. However, the exploratory character of data science projects, which do not start with a clear specification of what to do, but some data to analyse, present a challenge to the application of PBL. Looking for value in the data, building novel narratives and finding new insights is quite often perceived as unsystematic from the point of view of the students. Students get anxious soon. However, giving scaffolding as a step-by-step guide of what to do next is completely against the skills about curiosity, innovation and autonomy that a data scientist should possess. In this paper we introduce the characteristics of a standardised rubric that emphasises the value, the innovation and the narratives, and places it as the main scaffolding structure for the course. From the results of a PBL data science course at the MSc level, we see how the exploratory character of data science, as well as the range of proactive, curious and inquisitive skills that data scientist should have validates the application of this PBL design in data science courses.","2473-9464","978-1-6654-1468-5","10.1109/ICCSE51940.2021.9569289","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9569289","Data Science;Project Based-Learning;Assessment Tools","Industries;Computer science;Technological innovation;Education;Buildings;Collaboration;Data science","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses","problem solving;competitive skills;exploratory character;data science projects;PBL data science course;computer science;CS projects;project-based learning","","","","21","IEEE","21 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Project-Based Learning has been a trend in conducting teaching practices in modules related to software development. One of the cornerstones of Project-Based Learning is authenticity, a principle that guides the creation of software and development in the classroom by grounding it in a real-world context. However, the authenticity as addressed today in Project-Based Learning for software development, while recognizing that it is important to have quality in the end-user artifact, does not explicitly include User Experience (UX) in its scope. Creating software products that consider UX can have several advantages for students who create them and for a community that will benefit from these systems. This paper presents a proposal for a Project-Based Learning model that uses UX in the scope of projects. This model was built based on theoretical evidence found in a systematic literature review and practical evidence found in three exploratory case studies conducted during the development of this work.

The employability of engineering graduates is a matter of concern as employers accept knowledge in multi-disciplinarily areas. Graduates need to develop soft skills, the ability to solve situation-based problems and work in a team. In addition, graduates need to develop skills and attitudes for professional practice. It is a challenging task to train the graduates in an academic set-up for the changing work environment. These graduates are challenged with the unknown environment as they are part of multidisciplinary teams. Motivation: In engineering institutes, it is possible to train the graduates to work in multidisciplinary teams through projects. Project-Based Learning is a robust pedagogical strategy that trains the graduates to work in unfamiliar multidisciplinary teams, guiding students to develop skills and attitudes to work in changing environments. It also trains them to develop critical thinking and solve situation-based problems. Project-Based Learning is adopted at the university by encouraging students from multiple departments to participate in an engineering design competition to design, fabricate, and race formula-style vehicles. Objectives: To become a common platform for students participating in extracurricular projects to discuss and exchange ideas, design concepts and develop camaraderie. To be a forum for engineering talent from the institute to showcase their skills, innovate and acquire practical experience through mobility-related competitions.","","978-1-6654-2488-2","10.1109/WEEF/GEDC53299.2021.9657305","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9657305","Project Based Learning;Competence;Internship;Employability;Collaborations","Industries;Knowledge engineering;Entrepreneurship;Collaboration;Task analysis;Engineering education","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational institutions;engineering education;innovation management","project-Based Learning;enhance employability;concepts learnt;engineering graduates;situation-based problems;changing work environment;Project-Based Learning;unfamiliar multidisciplinary teams","","","","8","IEEE","4 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Student Assessment in PBL-Based Teaching Computing: Proposals and Results","G. B. Lopes; S. C. dos Santos","Centro de Inform&#x00E1;tica, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco,Recife,Brazil; Centro de Inform&#x00E1;tica, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco,Recife,Brazil","2021 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)","20 Dec 2021","2021","","","1","9","This Research Full Paper presents an overview of student assessment proposals for Problem-Based Learning (PBL) in Computing Education. Computing teaching has many challenges, as it requires different skills from students, often subjective and difficult to assess. In fact, technical knowledge alone is not enough to fully understand what is being taught, but the interpretive and logical skills to deal with practical problems and non-technical skills such as group work, creativity, critical vision, ability to cooperate and communicate. Active learning methodologies as Problem-Based Learning (PBL) have been used to dealing with such challenges, broadly developing technical and non-techniques skills in students. However, despite the benefits of PBL, the student assessment process is one of the points that present its own adversities and, therefore, an aspect that deserves greater attention. To better understand the nuances of this process and how it can contributes to the teaching and learning process based on PBL, this study aimed to investigate primary studies in the last two decades, seeking answers to the following research questions: RQ1) What assessment models are being used?; RQ2) Which aspects are evaluated?; RQ3) What criteria and media have been defined?; RQ4) Who gets involved in the assessment process?; RQ5) What is the ideal frequency to conduct the evaluations?; RQ6) What can these models reveal? As a research method, this study used the Systematic Literature Review method proposed by Kitchenham. As main conclusions, it was possible to identify that: generally, computing education based on PBL occurs at the undergraduate level, having as main educational objective the teaching of technical content; in practice, the need for a diverse teaching team is not reflected, the traditional student-teacher remains; to evaluate students, it is necessary to consider several aspects, technical and non-technical, defining specific criteria for each one of them; the main benefits for students are related to changes in behavior, development of soft skills and better absorption of technical knowledge; as main challenges for students, the difficulty to understand the nuances of the proposed problem and to be the main responsible for devising a solution for it without the figure of a teacher to give a clear definition of how to do it stands out.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637056","Computing Education;Problem-Based Learning;PBL;Student Assessment","Systematics;Computational modeling;Education;Proposals;Problem-solving;Object recognition;Usability","computer science education;educational courses;further education;teaching","PBL-based teaching;undergraduate level;systematic literature review method;problem-based learning;soft skills;technical content;active learning methodologies;logical skills;interpretive skills;technical knowledge;computing teaching;computing education;student assessment proposals","","","","65","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The pedagogy is formulated as a flipped-classroom PBL teaching model. It is adopted in teaching introductory business process management to master students at our university. Our experience shows that the teaching model is successful in engaging students in more self-directed learning, active learning, and peer learning. In general, students find that the face-to-face in-class time spending on problem-solving tasks is more helpful to their learning than direct instruction of materials. The lecturer also achieves more opportunities to observe the performance of individual students in problem-solving, understand their learning needs, and assist them with targeted feedback. BPM software is found to be an indispensable tool to facilitate the teaching of BPM problem-solving. It is believed that this experience is a clear indication that the use of the adopted flipped-classroom PBL teaching model with BPM software can be a highly effective method for teaching business process management.","2470-6698","978-1-6654-3687-8","10.1109/TALE52509.2021.9678885","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9678885","social constructivism;flipped classroom;problem-based learning;business process management;BPM software tools;teaching model","Electronic learning;Education;Power line communications;Software;Problem-solving;Online services;Task analysis","business data processing;computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;information systems;teaching","teaching business process management;problem-based learning;BPM software;graduate information systems courses;active learning;practical BPM problem-solving skills;flipped-classroom PBL;teaching introductory business process management;teaching model;peer learning;problem-solving tasks","","","","40","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The aim is to design a course that prepares teachers to teach programming, is relevant, and increases their self-efficacy. To contribute to this, we suggest a PjBL approach where teachers create a teaching plan during a project. Teachers may bring in their disciplinary knowledge and pedagogy combined with traditional and instructional methods to design an artifact that can be used directly in their practice. In the proposed model, teachers' projects act as a bridge between training and practice. We implemented the first version of the model in 2019 and used this experience to revise the model described in this paper. The results show that teachers are mainly satisfied with this form of PjBL. Many are favorable to this approach and express joy in teaching programming as they feel prepared and, at the same time, understand that programming can be demanding to learn and teach. Therefore, they are also mentally prepared for what is to come.","2165-9567","978-1-7281-8478-4","10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9453934","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9453934","Project-based Learning;In-service Teacher Training;Programming","Training;Bridges;Design methodology;Sociology;Tools;Reflection;Time factors","computer science education;teacher training;teaching","in-service teachers;PjBL;programming;project-based learning;teaching plan","","1","","59","","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the month-long, immersive summer program, participating faculty learn about software engineering best practices from an industry perspective, the recruitment, application, and interview process, engage in hands-on project development, and are exposed to the work culture at Google. One theme of the program is the importance of project-based learning and each faculty was tasked with designing and developing a project that they would then assign in their classes. While there was complete flexibility in the design of the project, the expectation was to adopt project-based learning that would support diverse and inclusive classrooms. Another important component of FIR is the recruitment, application and interview process used by Google and companies like it. This part of the program provides faculty with specific practices that they can implement in their classes to improve students' preparedness in applying and interviewing for technical internships and positions.

Projects are a key way to create value and benefits in organizations and the project manager plays a critical role in the leadership of a project team in order to achieve the project's objectives. In order to fulfill this role, the project manager must have some technical and soft skills. In a related perspective, there are several studies concerned with the comparison between what is covered by Computer Science Education and what are the software industry needs. Such studies point out in which areas graduates most frequently do not meet industry expectations, including technical skills and also soft skills. In this context, among the several approaches that have been proposed and applied to improve Computer Science Education, we highlight Project Based Learning (PBL). Aiming to address the lack of approaches focused on the development of soft skills in technology students, in this paper we discuss the conduction of a case study in Information Systems courses, adopting the PBL approach. In this case study, a real project was developed by the students, and soft skills were evaluated before and after performing the project, in order to verify if the PBL approach had any impact on their development. As a result, it was possible to identify improvements in the development of six out of the seven skills assessed, which indicates a satisfactory result for our study.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274099","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274099","Soft Skills;Project Based Learning;Project Management","Project management;Education;Leadership;Industries;Software;Computer science;Task analysis","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;further education;information systems;project management","information systems courses;project based learning;software industry;higher education;undergraduate degree programs;project management;PBL approach;computer science education;soft skills;technical skills","","","","35","","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper discusses a new first-term orientation course in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Oregon State University that is primarily taken by students pursuing a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. This course emphasizes collaboration and the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in engineering. The 10-week course contains engineering skills, tools, and concepts from three disciplines of engineering: Computer Science, Electrical & Computer Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. Materials focus on how each discipline supports the other disciplines in modern engineering. Students attend one, one-hour lecture and two, two-hour labs per week. The lecture covers general engineering concepts including engineering process, design, and tools/skills. Student engineers work in teams of three, with each student focusing on a different engineering discipline. Teams design, implement, and improve on a competitive robotic project. Assessment using student surveys shows a 13% higher self-reported ability to recognize and avoid personal and engineering discipline bias from students enrolled in the new course when compared to students in the traditional course. This higher assessment value has a confidence interval of p=.005 using a two-tail T-test. Using student surveys and assignments, additional preliminary improvements were seen in student's ability to identify the need of another engineer/engineering profession to complete a portion of a project and understanding of other majors.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274096","lab;first year;multidisciplinary;self-efficacy;interdisciplinary;collaborative","Collaboration;Robots;Electrical engineering;Tutorials;Tools;Software;Servomotors","computer science education;educational courses;electrical engineering education;mechanical engineering","electrical & computer engineering;general engineering concepts;interdisciplinary project-based learning;first-year orientation course;multidisciplinary understanding;traditional course;competitive robotic project;student engineers;modern engineering;mechanical engineering;computer science;Oregon State University;first-term orientation course;multidisciplinary cooperation","","","","13","","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In computer science education, these skills are of-ten practiced through group assignments, where students develop software collaboratively. The approach that students take in these assignments varies widely, but often involves a division of labour. It can then be argued whether collaboration still takes place. The discipline of computing education is especially interesting in this context, because some of its specific features (such as the variation in entry skill level and the use of source code repositories as collaboration platforms) are likely to influence the approach taken within groupwork. The aim of this research is to gain insight into the work division and allocation strategies applied by computer science students during group assignments. To this end, we interviewed twenty students of four universities. The thematic analysis shows that students tend to divide up the workload to enable working independently, with pair programming and code reviews being often employed. Motivated primarily by grade and efficiency factors, students choose and allocate tasks primarily based on their prior expertise and preferences. Based on our findings, we argue that the setup of group assignments can limit students' motivation for practicing new software engineering skills, and that interventions are needed towards encouraging experimentation and learning.","","978-1-6654-0138-8","10.1109/ICSE-SEET52601.2021.00037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9402173","Computing education, group projects, team work, programming","Training;Collaboration;Software;Resource management;Task analysis;Programming profession;Software engineering","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;groupware;human factors;programming;software engineering;source code (software);team working","pair programming;code reviews;group assignments;software engineering skills;computer science student teams;collaboration skills;computer science education;entry skill level;source code repositories;collaboration platforms;work division;allocation strategies;task allocation;students motivation","","","","41","","7 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the time being, these two Norwegian higher education institutions have not implemented graduate attributes into their curricula, though there are several ongoing initiatives that promote students' employability and development of professional competencies. Through interviews, observations, and thematic analysis with overtones of grounded theory, we aim to identify Norwegian IT students' perceptions of professional competencies acquired at project-based learning courses. The findings are analysed through the use of the identity and employability frameworks, taking into consideration the cultural context. This paper answers two research questions: 1) What professional competencies do students acquire in project-based learning settings? 2) How do project-based learning courses support the development of employability and identity? We have identified that putting more emphasis on graduate attributes can help to legitimise diverse ways of participation in the computing discipline and at the same time broaden its identity.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274073","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274073","Employability;Identity;PBL;Professional Competencies","Education;Charge coupled devices;Teamwork;Lenses;Companies;Games;Cultural differences","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;further education","collaborative project-based courses;Norwegian universities;Curtin graduate attributes;Norwegian higher education institutions;professional competencies;project-based learning courses;students' professional competencies;computing project courses;IT students","","1","","50","","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Software engineering is a young and promising discipline which is still under development and improvement. This is reflected when teaching software engineering in higher education. The aim of this study is to investigate the challenges and perspectives of software engineering education. To do so, a questionnaire study was conducted. 21 software engineering faculty and experts in teaching software engineering related courses participated in this study. The questionnaire contained demographic questions, questions related to students’ engagement and to different methodologies adopted by respondents in the classroom. Results showed that the majority of respondents found engaging students in software engineering courses to be the biggest challenge they faced in the classroom. Almost half of the participants found difficulties designing practical activities for students. Results also revealed that the problem-based learning approach is the most used in software engineering lectures, followed by gamification techniques and role-playing which are new trends used to engage students. Moreover, the majority of the participants considered that the adoption of new teaching methodologies in the classroom produced high impact in the students’ learning experience. Based on the outcomes of this questionnaire study, a conceptual model to engage students in software engineering courses is proposed. For future work, complementary studies should be implemented to evaluate the proposed model in a real-world scenarios including its effect on the achievement of learning outcomes.","2165-9567","978-1-7281-0930-5","10.1109/EDUCON45650.2020.9125353","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9125353","Software Engineering;Teaching Methodologies;Students’ engagement;Education","Terminology;Conferences;Education;Market research;Software;Engineering education;Faces","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;further education;software engineering;teaching","classroom;software engineering courses;software engineering lectures;questionnaire study;software engineering education;software engineering community;software engineering faculty;higher education;demographic questions;problem-based learning approach;gamification techniques;teaching methodologies;students engagement","","10","","48","","25 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Background: Internships and capstone projects are widely used to integrate work-related learning in computer engineering curricula. Both activities offer numerous benefits for students, industry, and academia. Although their effects have been extensively studied separately, the interaction between them remains unexplored. Research Questions: What is the effect of internships on the development of a subsequent capstone project? Methodology: The hypothesis was that the completion of an internship will have positive effects on several aspects of the capstone projects: 1) improved student competencies; 2) improved capstone project outcomes; and 3) decreased supervision effort. Further, these positive effects were expected to be greater in industry-based projects than in academic projects. The hypothesis was tested through a quantitative study of data collected from 274 computer science engineering capstone projects. A period of time with internships was compared with another period without internships, and differentiating between academic and industry projects. Findings: Internships prior to capstone projects improve student skills in autonomy, technology, methodology, and project management; increase the complexity and technological novelty of the resulting projects; and reduce advisor involvement in practical (technology, execution) and keep-the-project-alive issues, and increase advisor involvement in monitoring student work (meetings, reports, and initial arrangements).

It engages the learner in critical thinking, fosters introspection, improves retention, and enables generalization of concepts to new engineering situations. However, as projects often focus on software construction, students tend to adopt third-party technologies without critical reflection. Such insufficient supply chain risk management (SCRM) throughout the project then threatens learning success, as students struggle to recover from inadequacies and vulnerabilities in the adopted technology. We therefore propose a capstone-style course structure to deliver an industry-realistic, project-based, and teamwork-centric software development approach.

Therefore, communication skill development inevitably needed to be conducted remotely. Current mechanisms used in these remote sessions do not cater to unique needs of SE industry. This paper proposes a design of a plugin to be used with Zoom to analyze and improve student&#x0027;s communication skills real time. The proposed design is inclusive of two phases. In phase one, variables which determine communication skills are identified. In relation to these variables, student communication data will be collected for a period of a semester. The data collection will occur via Zoom sessions, for a selected project-based learning (PBL) module. In phase two, a machine learning model will be created using the gathered data in phase 1, and the plugin will be implemented.

Special attention is paid to highly abstract concepts such as high cohesion, low coupling, Keep it Short and Simple, Don't Repeat Yourself, Single Responsibility Principle, among other object-oriented design principles. The aim of such exercise is two-fold: (i) to address how design principles can be used to guide students' learning process, and (ii) to support pedagogical decision making for the software engineering program. The outtake of the whole research planned by the authors is as follows. On the one hand, design principles are discussed and analyzed, from the first-year programming courses perspective, aiming a pedagogical path planning for student outcomes attainment within a Project-Based-Learning approach. On the other hand, the discussion on how the program takes advantage of assessment and evaluation processes, can be useful for programs and faculty concerned with fulfilling the continuous improvement criterion, as defined by ABET. The presented work-in-progress focuses on reflection about design principles and establishing a link among them, with the engineering design process. In this way, this paper separates from similar works that may focus on design principles by itself, without the mentioned intentionality.

Background: Capstone courses constitute the culminating experience in engineering curricula. A core characteristic is the student team and project-based nature, with many team deliverables. The ensuing difficulty is to fairly assess the individual team member's contribution toward the team effort. Contribution: The method presented here is based on weekly peer evaluation of the individual team member's contribution, which subsequently yields a participation factor (PF), in turn scaling the team grade in accordance with the individual student performance. Intended Outcome: This method allows the timely adjustment of the individual student effort to match the group expectations and rewards high-performing students by making higher individual grades than the team average possible, while penalizing underperforming free riders by not benefiting from other student's performance. Application Design: The method allows students to continuously calibrate their own and their teammate's expectations and improve their peer score by adjusting their individual efforts. This feedback also requires students to practice professional communication, and in particular giving and receiving critical feedback, and thus is highly aligned with industry needs. Findings: Results evaluated over three iterations of the assessment process indicate a weak positive correlation (0.26) of the peer evaluation with the individual instructor-graded deliverables as well as the individual student grade point average (GPA, 0.23). Further, survey-based data indicate student agreement that the PF is a fair reflection of the individual performance, and a neutral perceived overall assessment system effectiveness, with reported primary barriers being the difficulty in assigning fair peer grades and of open, critical discussion.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2020.2970549","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9007387","Grading systems;project-based learning;senior design;student assessment;teamwork;undergraduate education","Teamwork;Education;Industries;Correlation;Mechanical engineering;Sensitivity","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;engineering education;team working","student agreement;survey-based data;individual instructor-graded deliverables;student performance;team grade;team effort;team member;student team;team-based engineering capstone projects;continuous peer evaluation","","3","","18","IEEE","24 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The ADJ framework consists of learning outcomes which represent problem-solving skills, a type of problems to assess those outcomes, and a three-step process for problem-solving. Problems are open-ended and ill-defined, like those in the real world. Although there are several approaches to instructing problem-solving, ADJ supports a course environment with four specific requirements: established syllabi (ADJ may be added to a class already covering many topics), scale (ADJ can handle large classes), modality (ADJ can be performed synchronously and asynchronously), and heterogeneity (ADJ helps to provide scaffolding for diverse student populations). This framework takes inspiration from Polya's problem-solving process and uses the theoretical foundations underlying Problem-based Learning (PBL). The ADJ framework was enacted in the fall 2019 section of a Software Engineering (SE) class on operating-systems at Arizona State University (ASU). In the class, students were introduced to the ADJ framework through a series of group activities, and then asked to solve three ADJ problem sets. Students responded positively to use of the ADJ framework as both an instructional tool for class material, and to mature their problem-solving skills. However, some students had issues carrying out the ADJ process due to its focus on justification as opposed to constructing designs.","2165-9567","978-1-7281-8478-4","10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9454055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9454055","engineering education;operating-systems;problem-based learning;problem-solving;scalable instruction;software engineering","Conferences;Sociology;Focusing;Tools;Trajectory;Problem-solving;Statistics","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;software engineering","problem-solving skills;ADJ framework;instructing problem-solving;ADJ process;analysis-design-justification framework;software engineering;Arizona State University;Polya problem-solving process;learning outcomes","","2","","28","","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, group projects are included in almost courses to train students' professional skills and teamwork abilities. However, in their group projects, most of the students are only required to accomplish functional requirements with limited awareness about the quality of the software. This issue seriously affects the development speed, since it is difficult for team members to read others' code during the development process. Hence, we propose a quality-driven assessment system for group projects with the capability of checking the coding style after each submission and providing immediate feedback to help student teams maintain the code quality for their group projects. Besides, to objectively assess the contribution of all students in group projects, we propose a set of repository mining metrics including two major categories of productivity and quality.

For this, we generate visualizations of aggregated Git metrics using inequality indexes and inter-decile ratios, which offer insights into the practices and processes followed by students and teams throughout the project development. This approach allowed us to identify both inequality among students' contributions and development processes with a non-steady pace, rendering a useful feedback tool for instructors and students during the development of the project.

In addition, the manufacturing industry needs new employees who can learn independently and cooperatively, and possess knowledge and skills in manufacturing. Project-based learning (PBL) is a learning method that allows independent and cooperative learning. Students who learned this method at the Tokyo University of Science in 2019 formed a small group and acquired not only technical skills in the manufacturing field but also interpersonal skills through communication and discussion with group members. However, the impact of COVID-19 in 2020 made it difficult to conduct face-to-face classes, making it was necessary to conduct online classes. As such, online education has attracted attention, as its allows learners and instructors to connect via the Internet and conduct classes remotely. However, in online learning, communication among learners may be insufficient. This study aims to encouraged students to share information by providing them with different information on how to improve their assembly skills and by giving them opportunities to communicate. It specifically investigates the effect of online PBL on the development of students in the manufacturing industry and examines the effect of PBL by introducing the LEGO block assembly training. With repeated assembly trainings, students improved their LEGO assembly skills and created assembly manuals for anyone to complete the task within a standard timeframe.

This study investigates how the use of character-based gamification for design team formation can help lecturers to address the problems of teamwork among design and media students as well as the new emerging challenges in online collaborative environments. In this gamified learning intervention, the personality, roles and abilities of students’ chosen game characters were used by the lecturers as references and insights to form teams for collaborative design projects. The data for the study is based on the teamwork experiences of 47 design and media students at a tertiary arts institution in Singapore. These students undertook team projects in no character assigned teams, random characters assigned teams, and characters matched teams assigned by matching students with the personalities, roles, and abilities of their chosen game characters. The results indicate that students’ perception of online teamwork experience was most positive when working in teams matched with game characters.

We propose a TRIAD education model, which is as an extension to the conventional project-based learning, by uniting industry staff, faculty members, and students in an online discussion space. This model is a two-phase cyclic model where in Phase-1) industry members and academic staff discuss the progress of PBL transparently, showing the cross-cultural gaps and advising how to solve them, and in Phase-2) students make progress on the projects. Additionally, the TRIAD model adopts asynchronous text messaging as a core communication method, which is suitable for a multi-timezone situation, as well as exchanges of self-reviews from students and feedback from instructors. The online space not only facilitates interns in overcoming the hurdles represented by the gaps between the industry and academia, but it also visualizes the students' implicit educational progress by periodically analyzing all stored data by applying quantitative text analysis methods. This paper shows the result of an empirical study by utilizing this TRIAD model and analytics tool conducted at a large-scale Japanese game company with over 2,000 employees focusing on two students from the division of game development at a university in Sweden. We applied a quantitative text analysis tool for this model during an on-going internship program to clarify how students change their thoughts and behaviors by acquiring cross-cultural professionalism in the game industry. In addition, the result indicates that this TRIAD model is resilient, even under the COVID-19 epidemic situation due to its text-based approach.","2325-4289","978-1-7281-4533-4","10.1109/CoG47356.2020.9231558","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9231558","game development education;industry-academia alliance;project-based learning;distance education;natural language processing;evidence-based education","Games;Industries;Education;Tools;Collaboration;Companies;Analytical models","computer aided instruction;computer games;educational institutions;groupware;personnel;software engineering;text analysis","Sweden;internship program;COVID-19 epidemic;project-based learning;students educational progress;game industry;cross-cultural professionalism;quantitative text analysis tool;large-scale Japanese game company;quantitative text analysis methods;TRIAD model;academic staff;two-phase cyclic model;online discussion space;faculty members;industry staff;TRIAD education model;academic organizations;industrial organizations;educational tool;swedish-Japanese industry-academia alliance;game development","","1","","31","","20 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The framework offers well defined stages of the group project which allow students to work on their choice of a real-world problem, integrate their learnings from previous courses, and present a working solution. In the group project, students actively participate, reflect, and contribute to achieving the goals set in the learning objectives of the course. Our framework incorporates key features from Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory (1984) and principles of active learning from Barnes (1989) to achieve active and experiential learning through active supervision. The use of group projects as a teaching pedagogy is widely adopted in many universities. Students work together, develop a plan, and demonstrate their abilities in building on existing knowledge acquired from previous courses, and apply them appropriately for problem solving. Prior to the pandemic, it was the norm for students to work on their group projects together by meeting physically on campus. Key benefits of working together physically are having the support of one another and the ease of communication. With the onset of the pandemic, safe distancing measures, and restrictions put in place have made it challenging for students to work on group projects together. During the pandemic, many courses were forced to move online with limited face-to-face learning opportunities on campus. This posed great challenges to the faculty in terms of effective supervision of students and their project progress. To mitigate the challenges, we devised a flexible strategy that makes use of both technology-based and non-technological means for monitoring students' group project milestones. The faculty receives continuous updates from students as they work towards each milestone. These milestones serve as important checkpoints for students. Continuous checks at different milestones help the faculty adopt appropriate intervention measures as issues arise. The group project learning framework consists of three main stages, namely Group Formation, Scoping of the Project, and Group Solutioning. The framework is overlaid with Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory concepts to describe the learnings, milestones, and deliverables of each stage. Each of these stages adopts Barnes's principles of active learning to enable active participation, reflection, and contribution by students. We evaluated the success of this framework through a comprehensive student survey analysis. The survey asked specific questions to students on all stages of the group project and the overarching component of teamwork and working online. We also present our findings and lessons learned for improvements of the framework. We believe that our framework will be valuable to educators in computing programs that wish to adopt effective supervision measures for group projects.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637162","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637162","COVID-19;group-based learning;experiential learning;active learning","Industries;COVID-19;Systematics;Pandemics;Education;Programming;Reflection","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;learning (artificial intelligence);problem solving;teaching","active learning;group project framework;learnings;experiential learning;students","","","","34","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is usually performed via students carrying out software projects, working in teams. In such environments, the knowledge sharing and the interactions within the team are worth investigating, as they can affect the outcome of the student collaboration and can provide insight on how the collaboration is valued by the team members. Research Questions: 1) What is the effect of TMS on students in SE education? 2) Do parameters, such as gender, affect TMS development? 3) Does the inclusion of a project manager with more expertise affect TMS? Methodology: Students were divided into teams working on SE projects. Teams consist of both undergraduate and postgraduate students. Data from students on TMS for consecutive academic years were gathered.

Teaching a Software Engineering related course for undergraduate students is a challenging task due to extremely frequent changes that appeared in programming paradigms and in software process development methodologies. In this everchanging domain, which presents us with opportunities and challenges every single day, it might be difficult and almost impossible for teachers to predict what are those knowledge that will be of use to students, on the long term, maybe even for five years from now. This rapid growth in the software development evolution has led to a gap between how teachers do knowledge transfer to students and how students acquire these knowledge. To bridge this gap there is a need to change how we teach these subjects. Thus, the new theory of education suggests that learner should be in the center of the learning process and the instructors playing an advising and facilitating role. A shift in education theory to a more student-centered approach using active learning is recommended because this approach has its own role to make the students creative and competent in their study. In this respect, active learning's main drive is to put the responsibility of learning at the hands of the learners themselves and to delegate the role of facilitator to the teacher. In this paper we provide novel approaches in teaching an undergraduate Software Engineering related course at the Babeş-Bolyai University. Its contribution is threefold: firstly, we introduce a new learning process design which selects active learning methods intertwining in teaching this course; secondly, we aim to study the impact of applying active learning methods on students' grades over the three academic years. Thirdly, we investigate students perceptions, their feedback and learning experiences on the use of applying active learning methods. Also, the paper reviews challenges and constraints that we faced while trying to teach this course. The analysis results show the effectiveness of our approach. Also, our students have expressed a high level of satisfaction, and in a survey, they indicated that the skills they learned in the course are highly applicable to their careers, facilitating their interviews for the engagement within IT companies.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9273935","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9273935","Project-based learning;formative assessment;summative assessment;multiple choice exam;student experience","Education;Learning systems;C# languages;Programming;Seminars;Process design;Java","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;software engineering;teaching","learning process design;active learning methods;students perceptions;feedback;learning experiences;active-learning methods;undergraduate students;software process development methodologies;software development evolution;student-centered approach;undergraduate software engineering","","","","24","","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Computational thinking is a broad term encompassing fundamental concepts of computing such as formulating problems and expressing their solutions in computational steps that can be processed by a computer. The ability to organize and analyze data is also a part of computational thinking. Following this paradigm, educational institutions have adopted various methods to teach computational thinking including programming. This paper will explore a specific project within the computational thinking course taught as an introductory course in all major programs at the Higher Colleges of Technology in the United Arab Emirates. The intention of the paper is to demonstrate how a project-based data analytics assessment in such a course can be used to foster in students, a greater awareness of a contemporary and critical global issue such as waste management. To examine the effectiveness of this project, the paper documents and evaluates the work of a group of students who carried out data analysis on secondary data collected from a notable website on “waste management”. The methodology implemented for this task is developed based on a prescribed course syllabus and assessment structure which promotes student-centered and inter-disciplinary learning.","","978-1-7281-4640-9","10.1109/ASET48392.2020.9118395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9118395","inter-disciplinary learning;cross-curricular;project-based learning;data analytics;coding;computer programming;global issues;waste management;computational thinking;engineering;digital;Python;academic;curriculum","Waste management;Data analysis;Collaborative work;Encoding;Task analysis;Programming profession;Creativity","computer aided instruction;computer science education;data analysis;educational courses;teaching;waste management","student awareness;interdisciplinary learning;student-centered learning;waste management;United Arab Emirates;Higher Colleges of Technology;project-based data analytics assessment;computational thinking course;contemporary global issues","","","","17","","16 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The course design aligns with best practices for promoting development of students' self-efficacy in solving ill-structured software design problems. Background: From Jonassen's theory, problem-solving outcomes are dependent on the problem structure, complexity, and representation; and the characteristics of the solver. These characteristics are diverse, including knowledge, familiarity, and psychometric qualities of the solver (e.g., self-efficacy and motivation). Thus, better problem-solving outcomes are dependent on the development of these traits, and on the problem characteristics. Intended Outcomes: Pre-2010, course learning activities and assessments overly focused on syntax. The course was redesigned with a focus on ill-structured problem solving and design in high-fidelity problem domains. Application Design: Complex and ill-structured lecture examples, assignments, and exams were redesigned to reinforce the importance of software design and problem solving. An open-ended cornerstone project using robotics was added as a structured means of providing students practice with solving ill-structured and open-ended problems. The assignment and exam questions, with the course cornerstone project, achieve instructional alignment in the course. Findings: The results show that students' self-efficacy improved from start to end of term.

The Central Connecticut State University (CCSU) Construction Management (CM) program is in the process of developing a Senior Capstone course, following the ADDIE (Analyze, Design, Develop, Implement, Evaluate) approach which is one of the proven instructional design approaches. One of the main objectives of this study is to demonstrate the use of a systematic approach to develop a Senior Capstone course, which is designed for construction engineering and management programs. However, since this course is still in development, this paper only presents the extent of what the authors have completed for a Senior Capstone course development. The authors believe that this course, after being fully developed, will not only provide students with the opportunity to build and demonstrate problem-solving and critical thinking skills but also help them transition from the classroom to the workforce.","","978-1-6654-0525-6","10.1109/ASEENE51624.2020.9292652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9292652","Senior Capstone;Course Design;Systematic Approach","Systematics;Problem-solving;Object recognition;Seminars;Leadership;Job shop scheduling;Companies","computer aided instruction;construction industry;educational courses;educational institutions;management education;structural engineering computing","analyze design develop implement evaluate;ADDIE;CCSU;systematic course design approach;management capstone course;central connecticut state university construction management;senior capstone course development;proven instructional design approaches;undergraduate CEM programs;management programs;undergraduate construction engineering","","","","17","","18 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Project courses are redesigned in order to better fit these methods, both with respect to content taught and how courses are organised. This position paper builds on experience with reviews as a feedback practice in a bachelor level project course. Reviews are a key element in agile development, but there has been little discussion in the software engineering education literature on the role of such reviews in improving feedback and assessment. Through examples of course improvement work in a course with about 140 students in 24 teams, we show how review practices are tailored to better comply with principles of good feedback practice which intend to empower students and help self-regulate learning. We argue that reviews can provide formative assessment and improve the learning outcome. Finally, we conclude with five lessons learned from three years of continuous improvement.","","978-1-6654-3196-5","10.1109/SEENG53126.2021.00011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9474641","software engineering education;capstone course;agile software development;Scrum;self-regulated learning.","Conferences;Education;Software;Continuous improvement;Next generation networking;Software engineering","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;engineering education;software engineering;teaching","agile iteration reviews;improved feedback;assessment practice;agile development;courses;bachelor level project course;software engineering education literature;course improvement work;review practices;good feedback practice;formative assessment;continuous improvement","","1","","14","","8 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A Scrum Team consists of a Scrum Master, a Product Owner, and developers. The Scrum Master role is vital in the team. However, looking at the industry, companies have difficulties both in hiring good Scrum Masters, and in convincing their developers or other personnel to take that role. Agile trainers do offer short Scrum Master training courses. However, we lack information on how to train Scrum Masters in university education. In this paper, we report how we arranged a one semester long Scrum Master training course. During the course, students worked as Scrum Masters under the guidance of professional agile coaches and collaborated in a Scrum Master Community of Practice. We collected data by conducting 13 post-course semi-structured interviews with Scrum Masters, and by analyzing the learning diaries of 37 students from three course instances. Team-specific Agile coaches supported their Scrum Master first by example, then by observing the Scrum Masters in action and providing feedback and ideas, and finally by helping the students to reflect. Students found the coaches extremely useful, and wished they had utilized them more. The Scrum Master community of practice worked best when students self-organized, shared practices and tools, and provided peer support when facing problems. Finally, students non-technical backgrounds, as well as female students performed better as Scrum Masters than computer science and male students.","","978-1-6654-0138-8","10.1109/ICSE-SEET52601.2021.00012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9402174","software engineering education;capstone course;Scrum","Training;Tools;Software;Personnel;Scrum (Software development);Interviews;Software engineering","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;personnel;project management;software development management;software engineering;software prototyping;teaching;team working;training","professional agile coaches;Scrum Master role;good Scrum Masters;short Scrum Master training courses;semester long Scrum Master training course;Scrum Master Community;Scrum Master community","","","","24","","7 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At our school, around fifty-five teams comprising of around 300 students take this course every year. With fifty-five teams, we needed a system to schedule presentations; improve communications; collaborate between stakeholders; share knowledge; monitor progress; team up students; match students to projects; improve grading process; showcase posters; and track improvements using analytics. The Learning Management Systems (LMS) is great to manage course content and grade submission. On the other hand, students are required to conduct agile sprint reviews with university internal and external stakeholders. The LMS forum requires external stakeholders to be registered and adhere to the university terms of use. Instead of using the LMS forum, we used a wiki. Wiki is a flexible platform used by various stakeholders to collaborate and contribute, we used it as a delivery platform for assessment as well. However, wiki lacks finer user access control and complex workflow features. In our capstone course we need workflows to schedule milestone presentations based on stakeholder's changing availabilities; to match students to teams using a content-based recommendation system; and to showcase project posters. We build custom systems to meet these workflow needs by proposing them as capstone course projects for our students. We share the lessons learnt from building custom systems. By sharing our experience, we hope to support more teachers willing to innovate in their use of technology in teaching.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274111","capstone course;learning management systems;wiki;workflow;teaching tools","Internet;Information services;Electronic publishing;Tools;Collaboration;Stakeholders;Education","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;project management;teaching","match students;content-based recommendation system;project posters;custom systems;manage capstone course projects;undergraduate computing capstone course;share knowledge;monitor progress;grading process;showcase posters;track improvements;learning management systems;course content;grade submission;agile sprint reviews;university internal;external stakeholders;LMS forum;university terms;wiki;delivery platform;finer user access control;complex workflow features;milestone presentations;stakeholder","","","","25","","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the second part, the students use the dedicated software environment to edit projects on their own, and at this point the PBL approach is used. This method enables students to self-organize their learning process and take an active part in the seminar. The idea for the seminar and virtual teaching lab evolved from the industrial use case of testing software for programmable logic controllers (PLCs) without the real machine, using virtual commissioning (VC).

The products include non-technical skills covered in research in the area and the relationship of the technical knowledge explored in each paper with the pillars of Industry 4.0. Also included are the most frequently methodologies related to this theme and teaching methodologies that complement engineering skills development with the Project-Based Teaching (PBL) approach. A formal protocol was used, applied using manuals and search filters. Exclusion criteria were involved, rejecting all papers associated with at least one exclusion criterion defined in the protocol. After applying the search string, 2513 papers were collected, of which only 18 were allowed without restrictions due to the exclusion requirements. This research allowed us to answer the following research questions: Which active learning methodologies are often used in conjunction with Project-Based Approaches (PBL) to improve the engineering profile in Industry 4.0? What skills are these students developing? How are performance assessments carried out during and after applying these methodologies? What is the relationship between classroom strategies and real-world problem-solving? The main results indicate that most of the mapped works are almost as naturally as the skills associated with computer simulation. However, few studies have explored more than two pillars of Industry 4.0 during classroom activities. Among the non-technical skills, such as those most often cited in teamwork, were communication (written and oral), learning autonomy, and time management. It was also possible to identify three main groups of approaches focused on solving real-world problems. The first group focused on solving real-world problems to improve technical skills (required by the industry or university). The second one focused on solving problems that are part of everyday life and social student interaction. A third group that develops projects to evaluate technical and non-technical skills focused on technology, a tool, or to consider a model.","","978-1-7281-9268-0","10.1109/LACLO50806.2020.9381161","Universidade de São Paulo; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9381161","Active Learning Methodologies;Industry 4.0;Systematic Review;Real-World Problem-Based Learning","Systematics;Protocols;Education;Manuals;Tools;Teamwork;Problem-solving","industrial training;production engineering computing;teaching","active learning methodologies;Industry 4.0 skills development;technical knowledge;teaching methodologies;complement engineering skills development;exclusion requirements;classroom activities;technical skills;project-based teaching approach","","","","62","","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Graduate attributes are the skills and behaviors embraced in the application of knowledge. Universities exercise discretion in the manner in which GAs are assessed be it as individual activities or as a dynamic interplay between a progression of activities.At a University of Technology in the Western Cape, an integrated computer project (ICP) was selected as an effective opportunity where eight GAs was assessed. This is the first time GAs will be measured in the final year of an undergraduate program. Within the ICP a range of principles was identified and pedagogies were employed to deliver the assigned GAs. In meeting a diverse range of learning outcomes for the ICP, the knowledge areas applied range from design and synthesis to computing and information technology. Transferable skills employed include teamwork, leadership, personal motivation, time management, research skills, analytical skills, listening skills, and written communication skills. The ICP harnesses the sub-competencies of the eight GAs as the evaluation criterion for associated activities.This paper offers a recollection of the development of the ICP from which the key principles framing the subject and the pedagogies employed to align the objectives and outcomes are identified and discussed. The principles and pedagogies form a framework that joins the five knowledge disciplines into a connected curriculum at a key point during the students' education to provide preparation for, and a small-scale experience of, professional engineering. This reflective study did not consider student perceptions or course evaluations at this time.","","978-1-7281-9756-2","10.1109/WEEF-GEDC49885.2020.9293686","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9293686","competencies;pedagogy;project-based learning;authenticity skills;multidisciplinarity;motivation;self-efficacy","Knowledge engineering;Tools;Transportation;Teamwork;Structural engineering;Reflection;Qualifications","educational courses;educational institutions;engineering education;further education;human factors;professional aspects","undergraduate engineering programs;universities;ICP;information technology;personal motivation;time management;research skills;analytical skills;written communication skills;knowledge disciplines;professional engineering;final year integrated computer engineering project;teamwork","","","","16","","22 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We analyzed how students' behavior on individual pre-project exercises predict team project outcomes, investigated how students' time management practices affected other team members, and analyzed how students divided their work among peers. Our results indicate that teams consisting of only low-performing students were the most dysfunctional in terms of workload balance, whereas teams with both low-and high-performing students performed almost as well as teams consisting of only high-performing students. This suggests that teams should combine students of varying skill levels rather than allowing teams with only low performers or letting students to form teams without constraints. We also observed that individual students' poor time management practices impair their teammates' time management. This underlines the importance of encouraging good time management practices. Most teams reported that they divided tasks in a way that is beneficial for the acquisition of technical skills rather than collaboration and communication skills. Only a few teams assigned tasks so that students would have worked only on tasks they already knew and thus felt most comfortable to work with.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274203","student project;time management;team configuration","Teamwork;Task analysis;Industries;Programming profession;Software;Tools;Software engineering","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational institutions;groupware;project management;software development management;team working;time management","low-performing students;letting students;individual students;teammate time management;individual time management practices;team configuration;student software projects;college students;individual pre-project exercises;team project outcomes;team members;work practices;class project;student behavior;student time management practices;high-performing students;collaboration skills;communication skills","","1","","49","","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At our institution, the switch happened in a matter of weeks which presented significant problems in teaching the fourth year Microwave Circuit Design courses. These courses were originally designed with a “studio” component where much of the design and experimentation happened during the so-called lab hours. Experimentation was very dependent on access to specialized and very expensive equipment, most importantly to VNA-s (vector network analyzers) and TDR oscilloscopes (time-domain reflectometry). Several compromises were made for online instruction: a) reduction of teaching material to essential components, b) use of inexpensive instrumentation, c) redesign of labs for off-line work, and d) reduction in the size of teams to two members instead of three. While the first may be advisable in any circumstances, the last two were driven primarily by logistical or organizational considerations. We report on how our “studio” environment was transformed into online “lab” assignments and how this affected course content. Key aspect of it is the development of affordable instrumentation that students can purchase themselves. This includes VNA-s and software-defined radios which are utilized as spectrum analyzers. We describe the initial uses of such instrumentation in our courses, their pros and cons, and the remaining issues. These developments have the potential to fundamentally change how we teach these and similar courses and we expect that many of the ideas being implemented will carry over into face-to-face instruction.","2623-8764","978-953-233-101-1","10.23919/MIPRO52101.2021.9596897","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9596897","engineering education;microwave circuits;project-based learning;microwave measurements;teamwork","Pandemics;Oscilloscopes;Switches;Network analyzers;Microwave devices;Reflectometry;Circuit synthesis","circuit CAD;computer aided instruction;distance learning;electrical engineering computing;electrical engineering education;Internet;microwave circuits;network analysers;teaching;time-domain reflectometry","online lab assignments;course content;spectrum analyzers;face-to-face instruction;high-frequency circuit design;online environment;COVID-19 pandemic;engineering education worldwide;studio component;lab hours;specialized equipment;vector network analyzers;TDR oscilloscopes;time-domain reflectometry;online instruction;inexpensive instrumentation;off-line work;logistical considerations;organizational considerations;studio environment;fourth year microwave circuit design courses","","","","22","","15 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some authors associate these difficulties with students' sentiments, such as motivation and engagement, others with the learning approach. Active learning approaches, such as PBL, have been used to stimulate motivation and engagement as well as to improve learning outcomes. However, there is little evidence on learning improvements with this approach as well as its association with students' sentiments in CS1 courses. From this perspective, our study carried out an analysis of a hybrid PBL approach adopted in an introductory programming course for majors seeking to understand how students' performances and sentiments are expressed in this case. We performed an exploratory analysis of students' sentiments and performances to understand the relation of this hybrid approach on these variables throughout the course. We also computed correlations and multiple regressions to understand how sentiments in a PBL approach relate to students' performances. Our results suggest that PBL has a positive effect on students' motivation and engagement, being larger in the former. They also confirm the significance of motivation over learning outcomes, with an emphasis on the confidence and satisfaction categories. Engagement is also significant to learning, with an emphasis on the the dedication category. Finally, students' performances were better in PBL tutorials than in lectures, but we found no significant correlation between performance in PBL tutorials and a language-independent CS1 concept inventory.","2165-9567","978-1-7281-8478-4","10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9453963","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9453963","","Correlation;Absorption;Statistical analysis;Conferences;Tutorials;Programming;Market research","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses","PBL tutorials;introductory programming course;learning approach;active learning approaches;learning outcomes;CS1 courses;hybrid PBL approach;language-independent CS1 concept inventory","","","","31","","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition, the research team conducted non-participatory observations in 2 courses, to identify elements of group dynamics in mixed gendered classes. This qualitative phase informed the quantitative study designed in the second phase. The quantitative phase took place in two computer programming courses associated to an undergraduate engineering program: Course A, which uses traditional lecture classes, and Course B, which uses project-based learning as the teaching methodology. In course B, a questionnaire (91 responses) was applied to identify the dynamics of role assignment in their teams. A self-efficacy questionnaire on computer programming was applied to courses A (n=33) and B (n =46) to compare the experience of women in the modality of individual and group work. The results indicate that women in course B tend to assume roles of coordination and work management, unlike men who define themselves as programmers or designers. The non-parametric tests applied indicate that when comparing the start and end of the course, the men and women of both courses significantly increased their overall self-efficacy. However, if only items that include execution tasks are considered, women in course B do not significantly improve their self-efficacy, unlike men from course B and both women and men from course A.

In light of the importance to operate and develop such technologies, academic programs in the communications engineering field demand an introduction to Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and SDR communication schemes accordingly. Typically, the teaching of this subject is afforded through projects and hands-on activities in classrooms. However, provided their relevance in the current state-of-the-art, this topic also provides a framework to teach soft skills concerning research abilities in students. This paper introduces an academic program to the development of SDR functionality as well as research skills based on exposure to state-of-the-art research. Through projects, hands-on activities are conducted to teach digital signal processing designs using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology. The course aims to develop technical skills to implement communication system blocks. Besides, workshops and seminars are prepared to support the development of research and communication skills. The proposed course is flexible to incorporate on a given academic program as an elective subject to further support topics related to communication theory and discrete-time signals. Learning outcomes are designed to develop enhanced technical skills in SDR design and simultaneously a critical discussion of the devised solutions in light of the state-of-the-art. Also, skills related to identifying, formulating, and discussing engineering problems are further reinforced. Results from supported projects developed in the classroom exhibit completed assignments superior to 90% of participant students. Learning objectives concerning the technical skills were successfully covered (90%) in comparison to research and communicating skills (80%). Additionally, research skills and the ability to disseminate knowledge gradually improved in seminars.

Students constantly need to reflect on themselves to understand the progress they made and what learning aspects they are currently lacking. As learning is a step-by-step process, therefore to achieve better consistency and learning experience, educational institutions are slowly transitioning summative learning to the combination of both formative and summative learning. Assessment is used to evaluate the progress of learning. However, existing peer assessment tool has limitation. It is unable to fit into all the use cases for different subjects. Moreover, the biasness of the instructor or peers has caused some of the students facing discrimination when doing the peer assessments. Integration of both formative and summative assessment into the peer assessment system could help instructors better understanding their students through feedback provided hence could improve learning strategies. In this paper, the authors proposed a web application, G-PAT, a peer assessment tool that enhances the flexibility of the template of the existing systems to cater different use cases. The SPA and SAPA factors from SPARKLUS are used in the calculation of performance and feedback of the students. The implementation results of G-PAT have shown that more than 90% of the students agree that the tool helps them to evaluate their performance and they are willing to continue to reuse it as their learning companion.","2324-8157","978-1-6654-0805-9","10.1109/ICRIIS53035.2021.9617037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9617037","Peer Assessment;Online Learning Tool;Formative Assessment;Summative Assessment","Technological innovation;Tools;Monitoring;Information systems","computer aided instruction;educational institutions;groupware;Internet;project management","summative learning;group peer assessment tool;group projects;educational institutions;formative learning;G-PAT Web application;SPARKLUS;student performance;student feedback","","","","22","IEEE","3 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The analysis of these data has led to a classification of the tools used by students in PjBL and guidelines for ensuring progression of tool usage in course design and study program design. The IT tools were classified into the following categories: Collaboration; Communication; Developer Platforms; Physical Tools; and Project Management. The analysis is done with reference to the existing body of literature on active learning, e.g. constructivism and constructionism, and taxonomies for learning. The study discusses ways in which tools may be used to enhance learning in the Creating level of Bloom's revised taxonomy. The data was further analysed through a ""lens of progression"", resulting in guidelines for study program designers and course designers, with the goal of quality assuring the tool implementation and usage in project-based IT courses and study programs. The guidelines systematically structure the tool categories with the study program design and recommend an increasing student autonomy throughout the progression of the studies. The guidelines also focus on the implementation of professional tools in IT courses, as tools are influencing students' identity development. The goal of the study is to contribute to the quality assurance of digital tool usage in IT study programs and the project-based courses, where it is important to define pre-requisites and to ensure that students learn to use different digital tools in the right order and that students know the necessary tools for their discipline.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274171","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274171","Technology Enhanced Learning;Active Learning;Create;IT Tools;Project-Based Learning","Tools;Education;Taxonomy;Hardware;Programming profession;Guidelines;Games","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;further education;project management;Web sites","student autonomy;IT courses;digital tool usage;project-based courses;fall semesters;IT tools;physical tools;course designers;project management","","1","","36","","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these issues, we demonstrate that Electronic Laboratory Notebooks can be used to promote student collaboration and teamwork on a group project. They can also help instructors assess student contributions fairly. During our investigations, we noticed that students have used Electronic Laboratory Notebooks as social interaction tools that enable text, data, images and recorded audio to be exchanged. Consequently, we describe the experiences of 58 transnational undergraduate students in using six different software products for a team-based learning activity. According to our investigations, Electronic Laboratory Notebooks had a positive impact on supporting Team Based Learning in a new electronic engineering course. The outcomes of our investigations can help create effective teaching and learning resources for undergraduate students in Electronic Engineering.

In the study area of Information Technologies, one of the subjects that is framed in this reality is that of software process. The software production industry considers it essential to increasingly improve its software development processes, so that different models were created for this purpose, such as CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) and MPS.BR (Brazilian Software Process Improvement Model), and norms such as ISO / IEC (International Organization for Standardization / International Electrotechnical Commission), pursuing this objective. In the consultation carried out from a survey of professionals with experience in the software market, it was seen that recent graduates need complementary courses to meet the skills required in the profession. In order to solve this situation, the following research questions were formulated: (i) What strategies can be used to teach the software process? (ii) How to use these strategies in the classroom? The main objective of this work is to describe, from a catalog, how to use the main strategies adopted for teaching and learning the software process. For the development of this research, a literature review was carried out in the main qualified conferences in the area of teaching in Information Technology with the collection of studies dealing with teaching on software process. After that, a description of each teaching strategy was carried out, identifying how to adopt it in the classroom and its example of use in the literature. The strategies covered by the catalog are: Flipped classroom, Project-based learning, Gamification, Serious games, Workshop, Software factory, Playful resources and Scrum Methodology. As a way of evaluating the catalog, a peer review was developed, based on the following steps: (i) planning, where the experts were identified and the creation of the questionnaire was developed; (ii) execution, with consultation with experts in the area of software process and teaching and learning from questionnaires; (iii) analysis and summary, where the experts' information was collected and analyzed and deliberated with due justification as to whether or not they would be implemented in the catalog. The main contribution of this work is a catalog evaluated by experts covering the description of how to adopt the strategies for teaching software process, based on the mapping of qualified literature, as an example of execution.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637428","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637428","teaching and learning;software process;strategies","Conferences;Education;Software;Production facilities;Serious games;Planning;Online services","Capability Maturity Model;computer aided instruction;computer science education;project management;software development management;software process improvement;teaching","software process subject;learning process;software production industry;software development processes;Brazilian Software Process Improvement Model;software market;teaching strategy;software factory;CMMI;Capability Maturity Model Integration;flipped classroom;project-based learning;gamification;serious games;Scrum methodology","","","","36","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In teams, students researched the social and environmental impacts of fitness trackers for their topic and gave a presentation to the class including leading a discussion. This project was designed to scaffold learning, encourage class participation, and enhance the quality of presentation. Survey responses revealed that all student respondents found the practice presentation with the instructors held over Zoom as helpful in completing their assignments and presentations. Other aspects that students rated as helpful included providing a list of resources to start their research and an example presentation to clarify expectations about depth required. The global COVID-19 pandemic necessitated the project presentations being conducted remotely, which gave students the opportunity to practice facilitating using Zoom, a skill that is directly relevant to current industrial practice. Students were creative in how they encouraged their classmates to participate including using Zoom polls, Kahoot, and breakout rooms. Students' responses to survey questions demonstrate that they learned about the sociotechnical nature of engineering, believed the project topics mattered to them as engineers, and these topics were relevant to their majors. Students cited the environmental, social, and legal aspects of the project as most interesting to them as engineers.

Students need to register for courses and earn credits in their four years of the degree. Face-to-face teaching, laboratory assignments, course projects, mini, minor and capstone projects are essential components that provide a holistic view of courses studied and practical hands-on experiences. Teachers' course delivery plan as per the schedule, contact hours, discussion, and continuous assessment are vital practices that make students on the learning wheel complete degree completion successfully. But, the COVID-19 pandemic has created the most significant disruption of education systems in human history, affecting nearly 1.6 billion learners in more than 200 countries. Lock down in schools, institutions, and other learning spaces have impacted more than 94% of the world's student population. This scenario has brought far-reaching changes in all aspects of our lives. Social distancing and restrictive movement policies have significantly disturbed traditional educational practices. In this paper, authors discuss challenges faced by students and faculty in the project space. We propose a novel collaborated approach for monitoring and carrying out projects during the pandemic in engineering at Under Graduate (UG) level. The success of this approach is based on collaboration and coordination between faculty and Students. Our proposed method uses tools and pedagogy approaches such as Learning Management System (LMS), MS Team (Microsoft), and Google Apps for documents to administrate student activities and communication. Also, phase-wise reviews helped to monitor the progress of projects. Significant challenges during this online monitoring and assessment were internet bandwidth and follow-up of individual contributions. The main advantages of this approach are improvement in communication skills, time management, distantly work in a team, sharing the code and project management. Student's and faculty's feedback, semester-end results speak positivity of the approach followed.","","978-1-6654-2488-2","10.1109/WEEF/GEDC53299.2021.9657245","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9657245","pandemic;reviews;assessment;monitor;learning management system","COVID-19;Schedules;Pandemics;Sociology;Wheels;Social factors;Teamwork","educational courses;educational institutions;engineering education;Internet;learning management systems;teaching","elective courses;face-to-face teaching;laboratory assignments;course projects;capstone projects;learning wheel complete degree completion;COVID-19 pandemic;education systems;human history;learning spaces;restrictive movement policies;pedagogy approaches;learning management system;online monitoring;project management;project progress monitoring;engineering undergraduate level;engineering curriculum;LMS;MS Team;Microsoft;Google Apps;phase-wise reviews;Internet bandwidth","","","","18","IEEE","4 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Simultaneously these students should have the ability to collaborate and work with people of different disciplines and be able to look for innovation. Engineering programs have been developing different approaches to enhance these required skills, for example through capstones and hackathons. Capstones projects, which are often several months long, aim to prepare students for the transition from school to work. Frequently, these projects are designed to serve companies or startups. Hackathon events are intense and short sessions where students solve a challenge in short periods of time, often between 24 to 36 hours. However, it is needed an approach that exposes students, of different disciplines, to a wider number of industries with a more collaborative approach. We need interventions in which students can experience how their knowledge contributes to the innovation and visions of different stakeholders. Furthermore, these learning interventions, where we promote a collaborative experience among the participants where everybody learns from everybody, should require less time than with capstones or hackathons. The University of Turku developed the Industrial Seminar on Future Technologies course for master and phd advanced students, where we address: multidisciplinarity, collaboration, connection with engineering industry and innovation. Students in this course are exposed to challenges and visions of different companies in diverse domains, e.g. biotechnology, metal industry, maritime. Each seminar session focuses on one company, and we work together to address the session's aim in at most four hours. For each session participants have a pre-assignment, which is aligned to the objective of the session, and a post-assignment that focuses on the session's reflection. An important aspect to make each session successful is the preparation of the session with the local company. Hence this course addresses different objectives: (i) Expose students to industry, (ii) Students gain awareness of how their knowledge is relevant for different industry challenges and visions, (iii) Collaboration between session participants (from different backgrounds and from the guest company), (iv) Possibility to innovate (“think out of the box”), (v) University of Turku builds bridges with the local industry, as together with each guest company we go through a process of “sharpening” the company's challenge or vision for this particular seminar session. In this paper we analyze this course with its outcomes, utilizing the final results of each session, and the feedback from students and industry representatives.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637449","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637449","hackathons;industry collaboration;multidisciplinarity;co-design;capstone","Industries;Seminars;Technological innovation;Conferences;Companies;Reflection;Teamwork","","","","","","15","","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Literature review: Prior research points to communication gaps among new engineers. Few studies have extensively examined transitions between academic and professional engineering contexts. Work remains for understanding how new engineers transfer communication skills. Research questions: 1. In what ways do new engineers transfer communication practices from school to work? 2. What challenges do new engineers experience in moving from communication as practiced at school to communication as practiced at work? Research methodology: This study presents a thematic analysis of data from weekly reflections and regular semistructured interviews conducted during new engineers' first year of work. Results and conclusions: Despite relying heavily on academic experiences involving both documenting and presenting technical work, new engineers report experiencing communication-related challenges. While further attention to communication activities can be given within engineering curricula, the complexity and situated nature of communication in the workplace cannot be fully replicated in the classroom. As new engineers move between school and work, they experience challenges adapting to a new environment including communication activities embedded within unique sociocultural contexts. While the classroom cannot fully replicate these professional settings and all of their nuances, students can be made more fully aware of the embedded nature of communication activities. Moreover, engineering educators can simulate aspects of the workplace in capstone courses, and companies can provide guidance to help mentor new engineers through the inevitable context gaps.","1558-1500","","10.1109/TPC.2021.3065854","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9411748","Capstone design;engineering communication;knowledge transfer;workplace communication","Employment;Writing;Interviews;Mechanical engineering;Engineering students;Knowledge transfer;Knowledge engineering","computer aided instruction;computer science education;cultural aspects;educational courses;educational institutions;engineering education;team working","environment including communication activities;engineering curricula;communication-related challenges;presenting technical work;documenting;engineers experience;engineers transfer communication practices;engineers transfer communication skills;professional engineering contexts;academic engineering contexts;communication gaps;engineering education;engineering work;new engineers;engineering educators","","1","","45","IEEE","22 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The challenge is that very limited focus is on preparing the faculty towards building interdisciplinary knowledge, skills and mentoring capabilities. The authors through this paper share an experience of deploying a faculty training model used for training the faculty towards mentoring interdisciplinary projects. The presented faculty development model is a result of the heuristic experience of four iterations and is organically evolved. The model was implemented in the context of a first-year engineering course titled Engineering Exploration. The course uses PBL pedagogy and every faculty, mentors a set of students to complete an interdisciplinary project. The nature of the projects in the course demands knowledge and skills from different domains to be applied at the mentioned stages. To mentor such interdisciplinary projects, faculty needs to be formally trained. However, in the literature authors found very limited architecture in the direction of standard frameworks and models that can be used to train the faculty towards interdisciplinary thinking and mentoring. The paper describes the evolved faculty training model consisting of four following phases where initial phases are focused on improving the technical skills among faculty members while the latter phase is focused on improving the mentoring skills.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637450","Faculty Development;Mentoring;Interdisciplinary Projects;Mentoring Skills","Training;Computer science;Computational modeling;Conferences;Employment;Prototypes;Mentoring","computer aided instruction;educational courses;engineering education","mentoring skills;interdisciplinary engineering projects;interdisciplinary skills;interdisciplinary knowledge;faculty development model;engineering exploration;faculty training model;PBL pedagogy","","","","14","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Team formation is a key activity for innovation, entrepreneurship, class projects, and industry initiatives. In parallel work, we have proposed a generalized framework for Algorithm-based Team Formation. We are interested to apply this framework to the specific task of forming teams for a Data Science project course. In this paper, we have focused on the characteristics teams as correlated by the success of the project itself. We find that by examining approximately 30 project teams, there are characteristics which may be used to set feature values for algorithms that can best match student projects together. In particular, teams who work well together with trust and common backgrounds did perform better. Teams with greater domain experience in coding and ML generally also performed better. Surprisingly, diversity in background did not seem to indicate better performance. However, we did observe that individuals who characterize themselves as optimistic and wide comfort zone among others were more strongly present on teams that performed well, speaking to a correlation of individual characteristics/behaviors to team performance.","2693-8855","978-1-6654-4963-2","10.1109/ICE/ITMC52061.2021.9570255","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9570255","team formation;policy;system based;teams;algorithms","Industries;Technological innovation;Correlation;Conferences;Entrepreneurship;Data science;Approximation algorithms","innovation management;team working","characteristics teams;student projects;algorithm based team formation;class projects;algorithm-based team formation;data project case application;data science project course","","","","25","IEEE","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these competences are not usually addressed in engineering curricula. In the Blended Academic International Mobility course, Blended-AIM, students develop their capstone project as members of an international and multidisciplinary team while working at their home institutions. Team members are geographically spread to assure heterogeneous teams and to promote international cooperation. This paradigm, although very suited for engineering degrees, can be adapted and applied in any project/internship course unit. The results from the first 10 editions of the course that ran between 2009/10 and 2018/19 support our initial hypothesis that Blended-AIM significantly promotes students’ soft skills without requiring costly and time consuming changes to prior degree curricula. It has the additional benefit of tearing down most of the barriers to international mobility in a sustainable way. In 2019/20 we are running the 11th, edition of the course and planning to transfer this innovative educational paradigm to new partners outside EU borders.","2165-9567","978-1-7281-0930-5","10.1109/EDUCON45650.2020.9125169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9125169","blended mobility;green education;soft skills;equity;employability;internationalization of education","Conferences;Collaboration;Planning;Engineering education","educational courses;engineering education;further education","collaborative communication skills;engineering curricula;Blended Academic International Mobility course;Blended-AIM;capstone project;multidisciplinary team;heterogeneous teams;engineering degrees","","1","","12","","25 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
